&lt;p&gt;On November 11, known &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/15492752"&gt;as Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt; through the countries of the British Commonwealth, the public honors those who died in the military service of their nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same date is observed as &lt;a href="https://publicholidays.fr/armistice-day/"&gt;Armistice Day&lt;/a&gt; in France and Belgium, in observance of the armistice ending the “Great War,” the First World War, 101 years ago today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, November 11 is Veterans Day, to honor all those who have worn the nation’s uniform. (Memorial Day, in May, is the U.S. counterpart to Britain’s Remembrance Day, to honor those who died in service.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this day, most public presentations in the U.S. include the line, “Thank you for your service.” In a long cover story for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; nearly five years ago, I argued that the real way today’s American public could honor the tiny fraction of its members in military service would be different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For perspective on the “tiny fraction”: At the time that I wrote that article, a total of about 2.5 million Americans, roughly three-quarters of 1 percent of the population, had served in Iraq or Afghanistan at any point in the post-9/11 years, many of them more than once. These days America’s total active-duty forces, in all branches, number less than 1.5 million, or well under one-half of 1 percent of the population. This is a different concept of “the 1 percent” than references to the economic elite.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article was called “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-tragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/?utm_source=feed"&gt;The Tragedy of the American Military&lt;/a&gt;,” and the opening page summarized its argument this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American public and its political leadership will do anything for the military except take it seriously. The result is a chickenhawk nation in which careless spending and strategic folly combine to lure America into endless wars it can’t win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that article came out, I received thousands of responses from service members or their families, a number of which you’ll see quoted in the posts in this thread. The vast majority were “positive,” in discussing the military’s keen awareness of its status in a “chickenhawk” era—one in which the country was constantly in battles, but only a handful of its people were directly exposed to the costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some circumstances have changed since that time; most have not. The phenomenon of “honoring the troops,” but then skating on to other matters, has, if anything, grown all the stronger over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-tragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/?utm_source=feed"&gt;is here&lt;/a&gt;.  I hope you will find a chance to read it; if there is further response, I’ll revive this discussion thread.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>2019 was a rocky year for superheroes — until ‘Watchmen’ raised the bar for the genre</title><link href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/12/01/was-rocky-year-superheroes-until-watchmen-raised-bar-genre/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2019-12-01T14:01:59Z</updated><author><name>Alyssa Rosenberg</name></author><id>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/12/01/was-rocky-year-superheroes-until-watchmen-raised-bar-genre/</id><summary type="html">&lt;table style="border: 1px solid #E0E0E0; margin: 0; padding: 0; background-color: #F0F0F0" valign="top" align="left" cellpadding="0" width="100%"&gt;

Which means that if you’re not already obsessed with the space opera that blends interplanetary politicking and battles with alien monsters, you’ve got a few months to catch up. But it’s not just science fiction fans who can find a lot to love in this show—so can anyone concerned with the habitability of humanity’s homeworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Expanse &lt;/em&gt;is set several centuries from now in a future where humans have spread across the Solar System.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;It focuses on the crew of the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-145m8ut-0 gaHZkC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/watch-as-we-attempt-to-navigate-amazon-s-3-wild-sdcc-ex-1835882426?_ga=2.248651076.2113997266.1563593029-1961725562.1559598084" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocinante&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a rag-tag group of former ice haulers who get swept up in the biggest scientific discovery of all time, one that threatens to shift the balance of power between Earth, Mars, and the “Belters” eking out a living on asteroids and the moons of the outer planets. There are cinematic space battles, political intrigues, and &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;-esque horror elements. But in a pop culture landscape seemingly obsessed with &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-145m8ut-0 gaHZkC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" href="https://gizmodo.com/tag/superheroes" rel="nofollow"&gt;superpowered humans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-145m8ut-0 gaHZkC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/that-sudden-game-of-thrones-turn-was-actually-a-long-ti-1834722527" rel="nofollow"&gt;dragon-fueled destruction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the thing that makes the &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; truly stand out is how often it gets the science right, including showing how ill-suited bipedal primates are to life in the vacuum of space.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;And by addressing that reality head on, the show—whether intentionally or not—makes a powerful case for &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-145m8ut-0 gaHZkC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" href="https://gizmodo.com/who-protects-earth-from-asteroids-1836193730?_ga=2.47364580.2113997266.1563593029-1961725562.1559598084" rel="nofollow"&gt;protecting the Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP"&gt;To be sure, there are signs we’ve already screwed Earth up pretty badly. While we don’t get a ton of backstory on how the geopolitical landscape of &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; came to be, from the books (co-written by Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham under the pseudonym James S.A. Corey)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;we know Earth’s 30 billion inhabitants are governed by a muscled-up version of the United Nations which appears to have consolidated power in the wake of some major environmental disasters in the 21st century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP"&gt;In a poignant shot from the show’s intro, we see that New York City—the seat of this supranational government—is surrounded by a giant seawall, suggesting that catastrophic &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-145m8ut-0 gaHZkC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" href="https://gizmodo.com/update-on-our-2020-climate-summit-1836340623?_ga=2.51974378.2113997266.1563593029-1961725562.1559598084" rel="nofollow"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was one of the history-altering events. And while it’s possible the UN government has the climate situation under control by the events of the show, the planet is still buckling under the burden of its outsized population. Chronic resource scarcity manifests itself both in Earth’s economic structure (a huge percentage of people are jobless, living in overcrowded housing on Basic Assistance from the government) and in the fact that Earthers are deeply reliant on resources extracted from the Belt, fueling a colonialist power dynamic that undergirds much of the show’s drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP"&gt;No doubt environmental woes and overcrowding on Earth are one reason people began colonizing space in the first place. And yet, while the culture of the Belt is steeped in ideals of personal liberty and opportunity, these swashbuckling space pioneers face a host of survival challenges of their own that stem from a different environmental issue: Simply put, there is none.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP"&gt;Instead of a planetary environment, Belters have cramped, uncomfortable living spaces inside cargo ships and asteroids. They breathe recycled air, shower in recycled water, and eat endless meals of textured fungal protein. Things that we take for granted on Earth, like fresh produce and abundant oxygen, Belters value more than gold, and they’re often on the verge of running out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP"&gt;And bare necessities aside, there are the more insidious challenges of spending a lifetime outside of Earth’s gravity well. &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-145m8ut-0 gaHZkC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/what-the-expanse-can-teach-us-about-how-life-in-space-w-1792483896" rel="nofollow"&gt;Belter bodies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are stretched and weakened to the point that mere moments on a planet’s surface can be torture, something that U.N. Deputy Undersecretary Chrisjen Avasarala exploits in a &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-145m8ut-0 gaHZkC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" href="https://expanse.fandom.com/wiki/Heikki_Sabong" rel="nofollow"&gt;memorable scene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the show’s first episode. They’re prone to strange diseases, like the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-145m8ut-0 gaHZkC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/two-of-the-expanses-biggest-storylines-have-finally-col-1825300142" rel="nofollow"&gt;immunodeficiency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; afflicting some children who’ve grown up on Jupiter’s moon Ganymede.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;While the disease is an invention of the show, the possibility that a lifetime in space will cause our immune systems to go haywire &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-145m8ut-0 gaHZkC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6038331/" rel="nofollow"&gt;is very real&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. So is the fact that we’d have to live deep inside rocks like moles to avoid becoming riddled with cancers from all the radiation exposure—and contend with whatever psychological idiosyncrasies, like extreme agoraphobia, such a lifestyle could cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP"&gt;By thoughtfully exploring the harsh realities of life in space, &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; reminds us that no matter where we go, we remain creatures of the Earth, dependent on a very narrow set of environmental conditions in order to survive. As the series’ multi-generational terraforming project on Mars reveals, those conditions are going to be &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-145m8ut-0 gaHZkC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypw47m/the-challenge-of-recreating-earth" rel="nofollow"&gt;incredibly hard to replicate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. And even future humans’ best attempts to do so, like the farms on Ganymede station, are far more precarious and vulnerable than their Earthly counterparts. That’s not to say Earth’s environment isn’t vulnerable—the very premise of &lt;em&gt;The Expanse &lt;/em&gt;tells us that it is, and if you read further along in the books, you’ll see just how much worse we humans can screw it up. But it’s telling that even after several centuries of life in space, Earth is still the only place that truly supports our existence. I suspect that whatever the crew of the Rocinante face in season four when they step foot &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-145m8ut-0 gaHZkC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/exclusive-the-expanse-showrunner-talks-the-move-to-ama-1836380625" rel="nofollow"&gt;onto a new alien world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will only serve to reinforce that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP"&gt;Saturn’s rings and Jupiter’s moons have an alluring beauty in the show. But for soil and seeds, for a protective atmosphere and a (relatively) stable climate, Earth is still home. And since that’s liable to be the case for as long as we’re eating carbon and breathing oxygen, what &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; tells me is that we better damn well protect it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more, make sure you’re following us on our new Instagram @&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-145m8ut-0 gaHZkC js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" href="https://www.instagram.com/io9dotcom/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;io9dotcom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Americans must make following the news and learning facts their patriotic duty</title><link href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/i-dont-know-what-to-believe-is-a-unpatriotic-cop-out-do-better-americans/2019/11/19/d6b998ae-1d23-11e6-b6e0-c53b7ef63b45_story.html?fbclid=IwAR3gLx3Vqr3fk7cGhT88mdOpuAF_x6vYXRNRj5RnmG28C511kVxP1oV7lco" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2019-11-25T17:29:01Z</updated><id>https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/i-dont-know-what-to-believe-is-a-unpatriotic-cop-out-do-better-americans/2019/11/19/d6b998ae-1d23-11e6-b6e0-c53b7ef63b45_story.html?fbclid=IwAR3gLx3Vqr3fk7cGhT88mdOpuAF_x6vYXRNRj5RnmG28C511kVxP1oV7lco</id><summary type="html">&lt;table style="border: 1px solid #E0E0E0; margin: 0; padding: 0; background-color: #F0F0F0" valign="top" align="left" cellpadding="0" width="100%"&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impeachment hearings, which that day had offered riveting testimony from diplomat Marie Yovanovitch? He merely shrugged: Didn’t know, didn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That plenty of Americans share this apathy about what’s happening in their government is appalling, but hardly shocking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many clearly &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care, as the movement of public opinion favoring impeachment suggests, but there’s a whole category that pollsters and pundits call “low-information voters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to go in and really research it,” she said, and she doubted that many people cared enough to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Roberts, writing in Vox this week, explored “&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/16/20964281/impeachment-hearings-trump-america-epistemic-crisis" rel="nofollow" title="www.vox.com"&gt;tribal epistemology&lt;/a&gt;” — the idea that “what’s good for our tribe” has become more important than facts, evidence, and documentation. He identifies a crisis that “involves Americans’ growing inability, not just to cooperate, but even to learn and know the same things, to have a shared understanding of reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts, the Times article and Florida Man all point to the same thing: A lot of Americans don’t know much and won’t exert themselves beyond their echo chambers to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the way a democracy self-destructs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what’s more, it’s not that difficult for American citizens to do much, much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, the flow of news is unending — exhausting, even. And granted, there’s a lot of disinformation out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But apathy — or giving in to confusion — is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m terrified that the idea that it is all too much and it is okay to tune out is getting socialized as an acceptable response,” said Dru Menaker, chief operating officer of PEN America, the free-expression advocacy organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our country is being challenged to its very core, and we have an obligation to pay attention precisely because things are so overwhelming,” she told me by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t agree more. And it’s not really all that hard to develop some constructive news habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t take a research project into every claim and counterclaim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If every American did any&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;two of the following things, the “who knows?” club could be swiftly disbanded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subscribe to a national newspaper and go beyond the headlines into the substance of the main articles; subscribe to your local newspaper and read it thoroughly — in print, if possible; watch the top of “PBS NewsHour” every night; watch the first 15 minutes of the half-hour broadcast nightly news; tune in to a public-radio news broadcast; do a simple fact-check search when you hear conflicting claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who can’t afford to subscribe to newspapers, almost all public libraries can provide access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whatever the president wants us to believe, there are tested and reliable news sources,” Menaker noted. “There are even more firsthand sources than ever where you can judge yourself — links to documents, video clips, hours of televised testimony.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would also offer this small list of things to &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; doing: Stop getting your news and opinions from social media. Stop watching Fox News, especially the prime-time shows, which are increasingly untethered to reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If every American gave 30 minutes a day to an earnest and open-minded effort to stay on top of the news, we might actually find our way out of this crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Walter Shaub, former director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, noted Tuesday on Twitter, it was on Nov. 19, 1863, that President Lincoln challenged his fellow citizens to rise to a “great task.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans must dedicate themselves to ensuring, Lincoln urged in the Gettysburg Address, “that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, too, in this historic moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, authoritarianism loves nothing more than a know-nothing vacuum: people who throw up their hands and say they can’t tell facts from lies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And democracy needs news consumers — let’s call them patriotic citizens — who stay informed and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flag-waving is fine. But truth-seeking is what really matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Wildfires threaten Redding homes near dense vegetation.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shawn and Claudia Hazeleur used to feel safe from wildfire because they lived in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildfires happened “out there” in the forest, but not in Redding where there are sidewalks, streets and backyards, Claudia Hazeleur said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But last year’s Carr Fire changed all that when it burned into Redding and surrounding communities, destroying 1,614 buildings and killing eight people on its way to burning nearly 230,000 acres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Carr Fire, Hazeleur and her husband Shawn wonder what will happen if another fire threatens the west side of Redding and their neighborhood. The sense of security is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The canyons surrounding the Hazeleur's home on Blue Bell Drive in southwest Redding are thick with brush and trees and that worries them, Shawn Hazeleur said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If any kind of fire starts back there, I think our house would go,” Shawn Hazeleur said. “If it got into the canyon there, I don’t think they could stop it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hazeleurs' concerns reflect Redding's reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillsides covered in thick brush surround the city and wind their way through it in wide greenbelts. As the Carr Fire demonstrated, it's that low vegetation that fuels hot, fast-moving fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents throughout Redding’s north, west and south areas are surrounded by wildfire threats they don’t control — large plots of undeveloped property choked with vegetation that, a new analysis shows, looks very much like the dense brush and dry trees that provided the Carr Fire its fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three landowners — the city of Redding, the federal government and the McConnell Foundation — own 22 percent of land in the Redding sphere of influence, according to an exclusive analysis by the Record Searchlight and ENPLAN, a Redding-based firm that specializes in geospatial analysis and environmental planning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city, by far the largest of those landowners with 1,790 acres of open land that isn’t part of its maintained park system or other facilities, is taking a go-slow approach to addressing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It faces lawsuits in the wake of the Carr Fire, including one class action suit that also names the California Department of Transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City Manager Barry Tippin, when shown the ENPLAN/Record Searchlight analysis, said it shows nothing new. He suggested the federal land in the county, not the city’s own holdings, should be the focus of concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he offered nothing in the way of new plans to address the 1,790 acres of dense, dry vegetation on the city’s property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, he did say the fire department is getting a boost with the hiring of 18 more firefighters, 12 of whom will be apprentices assigned to fire-fuels management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The definition of management is to the eye of the beholder, but it's natural forestland," Tippin said. "It's a more complex conversation than people make it." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous vegetation surrounds the city, 'presents a very high fire hazard'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership between the newspaper and ENPLAN stretched over five months of data analysis and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using public records and airborne laser survey data (LiDAR) collected in 2016, ENPLAN created a map of Redding and its immediate surroundings that, for the first time, allows anyone to see the actual patterns of woody vegetation — especially where it’s of low-to-medium height indicating chaparral brush, the fuel of greatest fire risk according to experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LiDAR data applications have been a specialty of ENPLAN since 2004 when the firm collected over 800 square miles of it covering the Shasta-Tehama County region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ENPLAN map, built using the online software platform the company has created, MapPort, combines that information with property lines and ownership, allowing for a clear picture not only of where the hazards exist but who owns that land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What stood out the most is there's so much continuity of vegetation fuel surrounding the city and feeding into the city. That's something very concerning for the future," said geospatial technologist Catalina Llanos, one of the firm’s employees who helped create the map under the direction of Randall Hauser, the firm's CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the arrows on the blue bar of the map below for more options. The most dangerous vegetation, where it’s medium height and dense, is marked on the map in red. &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.redding.com/story/news/2019/11/06/redding-wildfire-risk-map-dangerous-dense-vegetation-dry-trees/1823788001/" rel="nofollow"&gt;For a breakdown of the data, click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hauser said the map shows how over the past 20 years, subdivisions were built on the west side of Redding along ridge tops, giving many homeowners backyard vistas of the surrounding canyons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those canyons also pose a grave threat. Many of them are choked with dense brush that hasn't burned or been thinned in decades, creating a fire hazard, Hauser said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Capt. Nick Wallingford said ENPLAN's map corresponds with the maps his agency produces that warn of fire hazards and it accurately represents vegetation heights, particularly for west Redding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Those vegetation heights do correlate to what Cal Fire classifies as a very high-fire hazard severity zone, which is our highest and most severe level of fire hazard severity zone," Wallingford said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Cal Fire's latest such fire map shows Land Park and Stanford Hills in the thick of the very high-fire severity zone that burned in the Carr Fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The areas, especially to the north and to the west of Redding, and then to the east have significant, significant fuel loading. That presents a very high fire hazard," Wallingford said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unmanaged woodland can fuel wildfires:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.redding.com/story/news/2019/11/06/redding-wildfire-risk-map-dangerous-dense-vegetation-dry-trees/1823788001/" rel="nofollow"&gt;This map shows where it is, who owns it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redding Fire Marshal Craig Wittner said those canyons that appear a deep orange-red on the ENPLAN map are filled with the kind of thick mix of brush, grass and trees that burn the most intensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story continues below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because most of Redding proper has not burned in recorded history, unmanaged vegetation in the city built up largely unabated, a dangerous fuel for future wildfires.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'It's just a tinder box': A dozen neighborhoods at high wildfire risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those orange-red colored canyons surround subdivisions like Country Heights, White Hawk Estates, Stanford Hills, Land Park and River Ridge Park. At the north end of Redding, the Buckeye district backs up to tracts of undeveloped land on the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, about a dozen neighborhoods stand out for their high exposure to large tracts of dense vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wildfire-risk map:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.redding.com/story/news/2019/11/06/california-wildfire-risk-map-redding-fire-hazard-shasta-county-enplan/1682699001/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here's how the project came together&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The west side subdivisions are on ridges. Hauser pointed out that fire often burns faster uphill, "putting houses along those ridges at significant risk, especially if vegetative fuel is not cleared back extensively. Embers and fire brands regularly travel half a mile ahead of the fire and houses are about the most flammable fuel in the environment," Hauser said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like their neighbors, Tina Maravelias and Mike Rowe bought a house in White Hawk Estates to enjoy the ridge-top view and the lush greenbelt of trees and brush that grow up a steep hillside right up to their backyard fence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Rowe and Maravelias said the Carr Fire has made them more aware of how the greenbelt surrounding their home can be dangerous unless it is kept thinned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Redding sent a crew out over the summer to clear out some of the undergrowth behind the couple's home on Dream Street. But Rowe said the crew left behind the piles of limbs that would become fuel if a fire burned through the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew also thinned out the undergrowth but left behind the taller gray pines and thick oak trees. Many of those trees were damaged in a historic February snowstorm that left behind broken branches that are now a fire hazard, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pointed to a gray pine branch hanging dead on a tree, the needles brown and dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Those needles right there, if you just breathed hot air on them they would go up," Rowe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carr Fire recovery: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.redding.com/story/news/local/2019/10/05/volunteers-re-plant-trees-shrubs-help-carr-fire-restoration-efforts/3877057002/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Volunteers plant trees to help Carr Fire restoration efforts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the chaparral vegetation in Redding’s 1,790 acres of land designated as open space (1,430 acres) or unused public land (360 acres)  — where the city prohibits building — shows up on the laser imaging as densely vegetated. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map's Carr Fire boundary gives a look into how the chaparral vegetation helped form a path of flames that led into Redding's westerly neighborhoods — and how much that vegetation looks like other areas of the city that haven’t yet burned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wittner said the city plans to burn up those piles during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018 the city of Redding had sent crews out to thin about 150 acres, Wittner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wittner said crews did work on parcels that totaled 150 acres, but not all of that was thinned. Rather the perimeter of the parcels, 100 feet from the property lines, was thinned, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the city has about $25,000 a year for thinning, which is used to pay the cost of hiring crews from the Sugar Pine Conservation Camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the city kept up the pace of thinning 150 acres annually, it would take about 12 years to thin the perimeters of all of its 1,790 acres of unmanaged land, by which point vegetation in the perimeters thinned at the beginning of that 12-year period will have substantially regrown and the fuel content re-established.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wittner said the city isn't attempting to tackle all of its open space holdings. Instead, the city is thinning the first 100 feet from along property lines, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I don't know what the end result is going to be for the remainder of those untreated fuels," Wittner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city has not received state grants to pay for its thinning projects, limiting the amount of money it can spend on thinning projects, he said. He said the city did not apply for any grants to pay for thinning because the city doesn't have a grant writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many grants require matching funds, which the city may not have, he said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betty Cochran said she often wonders what would happen if fire broke out in the mass of overgrown brush and trees that line the sides of Teton Drive to her home in White Hawk Estates in southwest Redding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know what fire can do, and it can do more than we think," Cochran said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many open spaces around town are now filled with dead and dying trees and brush from the Feb. 13 snowstorm, Tina Maravelias said. The open space along Buenaventura Boulevard is a prime example, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The snow hit that so hard. Whole trees are just laying there. It's just a tinderbox," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Snowstorms, wildfires leave dead trees in need of clearing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 2,036 acres, the federal government is the third largest landowner in the city's sphere of influence. Much of that land burned in the Carr Fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large swaths of land along the Sacramento River northwest of Redding is managed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The rest is under the Bureau of Land Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BLM has worked on several hundred acres in the wake of the Carr Fire clearing trails and unstable trees from along trails. The agency then returned to many of those areas after the snowstorm brought more trees to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story continues below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BLM in Redding recently has been focused on clearing dead and dying trees and brush in the Swasey Recreation Area west of Redding, which also burned in the Carr Fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Strait, a BLM fire mitigation and education specialist, said the agency's main concern was making the area safe for the hikers and others who use the trails off Swasey Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A secondary concern, he said, was the danger the dead trees and brush posed if another fire burned through the Swasey area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018 before the Carr Fire, the BLM had at least 600 acres identified for clearing. Even though last summer's blaze burned into some of those projects, work still was needed to clear the scorched vegetation and trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BLM is thinning brush and trees on 276 acres in the Redding area, including 42 acres in the Yankee John Mine area, a 192-acre plot just south of Placer Road in west Redding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Property-owner McConnell eyes large-scale project to reduce wildfire fuel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning in mid-July, homeowner Carl Davis was happy to have a McConnell crew outside weed-eating the straw-brown grass that sits between his home just west of Lake Boulevard and a 77-acre parcel belonging to the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They've been good neighbors. McConnell has been vigilant about keeping a fire break between our property and all the other residents here," Davis said. "They've been pretty prompt and outgoing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundation does the fuel-reduction work with its own four-person crew and has three brush- and tree-mulching masticators. Their focus is on McConnell land next to residences and other developed land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When I first got here five years ago, I'd lose sleep over the condition of our property," said Alex Carter, McConnell's director of land management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story continues below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now I feel actually fairly comfortable," he said. "Our crews have been hard at work pretty consistently."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundation is backing a county-wide effort. Earlier this year, it obtained a $12.7 million grant from Cal Fire to help coordinate projects beginning in 2020 at an elevated risk of burning in Shasta County. The works must be done by mid-March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crews will work to treat some 2,000 acres of roadside fuel and more than 700 acres of ridgeline. The areas that will be treated are Trinity Mountain Road northwest of Whiskeytown Lake, Keswick, Rock Creek Road and other roads north of Highway 299, and from Swasey Drive to Whiskeytown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer's Carr Fire burned over much of the property slated to be cleared and thinned. Carter said it's important to go back in and remove the dead trees scorched by the fire and stop the regrowth of fire-prone, invasive vegetation because if left untreated the area could burn even more intensely in the next big fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of McConnell's $12.7 million project is to treat the land so when fire happens again there, it will be a lower-intensity burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crews are doing the work in an era when wildfires are burning bigger and the season is longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story continues below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year later: Areas scarred by the Carr Fire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photos and interviews show what has changed and what hasn't one year since the Carr Fire hit the Redding area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Brannon, Redding Record Searchlight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Interagency Fire Center figures show the amount of acres that burn has doubled since 1990, and in the Western U.S., the season is nearly three months longer than it was in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, last year's Camp Fire and the 2017 North Bay fires that devastated California's wine country happened in November and October, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter talked about the challenges in these extreme wildfire conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He held up a printed Google Earth image taken in June 2017 — four months before the Tubbs Fire — of the Fountain Grove Club community in Santa Rosa. The homes back up to a well-manicured 18-hole golf course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he shows another Google Earth image of the same neighborhood taken in February 2018, four months after the Tubbs Fire. Vacant lots sit where homes once stood, though green fairways still surround the properties. The homes were among more than 1,500 in the Fountain Grove community destroyed in the Tubbs Fire, according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wind-whipped embers from the Tubbs Fire flew over the golf course, igniting homes in the Fountain Grove neighborhood, Carter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hail of embers also drove much of the destruction in the Carr and Camp fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even if we get rid of all the fuel, is it going to save these houses in neighborhoods if (residents) don't have their homes 100 percent defensible?" Carter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story continues below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too, Carter pointed out that the Carr Fire ripped through acreage burned previously by the Motion Fire in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You want to catch the fire at the ridges, you want to catch the fire at the roadway" before it gains more momentum and gets into surrounding neighborhoods, Carter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Both the Carr and Camp fires burned through 2008 burn scars and picked up energy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Carter doesn't downplay the importance of managing the more than 4,000 acres the McConnell Foundation owns within the city of Redding's sphere of influence, he said the best use of its resources is to work with other agencies on large-scale fuel reduction projects, or big-landscape strategies, to help reduce the probability of the next high-intensity large-scale wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So we're doing what we can on our property," he said. "But if that's the only strategy we deploy in Redding — concentrating on the 100 largest parcels — it might not prevent the next Carr Fire."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carter acknowledges the Carr Fire was a phenomenon, fueling winds of more than 150 miles per hour, equal to an EF-3 tornado. The plume it spawned was about 40,000 feet in height — cruising altitude for commercial airliners — with a diameter the size of more than three football fields at the base. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Carr Fire happening in the same condition, how effective our work would be, it's unknown," Carter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not how they roll in Ohio, which is one of the reasons the Erwins are loving their new home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every time I go out to dinner,” he said, “I look at the check and think, ‘Where’s the other half?’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wish all our friends in Santa Rosa the best,” Erwin said, “and pray the last few months are not the ‘new normal’ for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing ‘positive action’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrie Brown is an author, artist, caterer and proprietor of Jimtown Store in the Alexander Valley, renowned for its world-class wines. In the days during and after the Kincade fire, she also was a grief counselor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had people coming in here in tears, people who lost homes, who lost everything,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she gets why some people would find themselves wanting to move, Brown isn’t going anywhere. She refuses to accept the current state of affairs as the “new normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a native Californian,” she said. “I love our state, I love this community, and I’m not giving up. I choose hope. I choose positive action and resistance. This is a call to arms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That call, as she hears it, is a summons to ditch PG&amp;amp;E in favor of smaller, community operated, utility-busting microgrids, and to lean more heavily on renewable sources of energy, such as solar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s a campaign that will take years, if not decades, to play out. Some people can’t wait that long for the situation to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frances Kern is 81 and in good health. But she found those six days in late October without power “incredibly stressful and exhausting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the most recent PG&amp;amp;E blackout, Kern, who lives in the retirement community of Oakmont Village, said she was down to eating soup and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. She slept poorly, awakened by constant alerts from PG&amp;amp;E and law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual wildfire drama will result in Californians leaving the state “in droves,” she predicted. Were it not for her age, she said, “I would be among the first to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is this the way I want to spend every October,” asked the recently retired John Hirsekorn of Rincon Valley, “wondering if my house is going to burn down?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it continues and PG&amp;amp;E doesn’t get its act together, then, no, I don’t want to do this every year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He might consider following the example of Sebastopol’s Rocky Daniels, who coined the term “firebird.” Similar to “snowbirds,” retirees who migrate south from New England to escape cold, firebirds leave the Golden State to escape the flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After putting his valuables in storage, said Daniels, in a brief phone interview from Mexico, where he’s spent the past few fire seasons, “you grab the cat and leave the country until November.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re retired and don’t want to entirely uproot your life,” he said, “being a firebird makes perfect sense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fires weakening resilience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his Larkfield-Wikiup house burned in the Tubbs fire, Santa Rosa engineer Francois Piccin became a block captain. He poured his energy into helping his neighbors rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His focus and optimism went missing as the Kincade fire bore down on his burned lot, threatening to scorch it a second time. Two weeks before the blaze, he’d signed a contract with his builder. As the inferno churned south, “I was really reconsidering,” he said. He shared with his wife, Christine, that he didn’t know if he could feel safe again, in that place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Bryan Brothers Will Retire From Tennis After 2020 U.S. Open</title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/sports/tennis/bryan-brothers-retirement.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rss" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2019-11-18T02:54:42Z</updated><author><name>Ben Rothenberg</name></author><id>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/sports/tennis/bryan-brothers-retirement.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rss</id><summary type="html">&lt;table style="border: 1px solid #E0E0E0; margin: 0; padding: 0; background-color: #F0F0F0" valign="top" align="left" cellpadding="0" width="100%"&gt;

&lt;hr style="clear: both; margin: 0 0 24px;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think $300 million in costs cut is a big number? Try $400 million. Or &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the internal numbers in the air as America&amp;#8217;s two largest newspaper chains, &lt;a href="https://www.gannett.com"&gt;Gannett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.gatehousemedia.com"&gt;GateHouse&lt;/a&gt;, try to land their megamerger, &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/08/newsonomics-the-gatehouse-gannett-newspaper-megamerger-could-be-announced-as-soon-as-tomorrow-morning/"&gt;first announced in August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the money: When I first &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/07/newsonomics-its-looking-like-gannett-will-be-acquired-by-gatehouse-creating-a-newspaper-megachain-like-the-u-s-has-never-seen/"&gt;wrote about this potential union&lt;/a&gt; back in July, the estimated annual cost savings — &amp;#8220;synergy&amp;#8221; — to be derived from a merger was &amp;#8220;something like $200 million.&amp;#8221; By &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/08/newsonomics-the-gatehouse-gannett-newspaper-megamerger-could-be-announced-as-soon-as-tomorrow-morning/"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt;, it was &amp;#8220;$200 to 300 million.&amp;#8221; &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/08/newsonomics-the-perils-and-promises-of-new-gannett/"&gt;Then it was&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;$275–300 million.&amp;#8221; Now, talk has gone to $400 million and beyond, into the range of &lt;em&gt;nearly half a billion dollars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that mean? Almost certainly, even more reduction in headcount than had been anticipated. (Executives declined to comment on the amount the synergies they&amp;#8217;re now eyeing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much? In any room of eight people at a current GateHouse or Gannett operation, one is likely to see her job gone in 2020. One in eight would add up to 3,450 of the combined companies&amp;#8217; 27,600 jobs. Some observers expect that the final total to be higher than that. And the company won&amp;#8217;t wait for the first of the year to begin layoffs: With immediate savings a priority, expect those anxiety-inducing conversations to begin right after Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those layoffs may well be on top of those already going forward in current Gannett newsrooms. As Gannett finishes its regular budgeting for 2020, its newsrooms can expect 3 to 5 percent cuts in their budgets, sources tell me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning marked the penultimate go-ahead in what has been a yearlong process. Shareholders of both Gannett and GateHouse voted this morning on the merger, which will create a giant (for newspapers) company that will retain the Gannett name. (The shareholders voting for GateHouse are owners of &lt;a href="https://www.newmediainv.com/"&gt;New Media Investment Group&lt;/a&gt;, a.k.a. &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=fin&amp;#038;sxsrf=ACYBGNScmq2CZyV0eJfBIf_ngKnLpyLpBQ:1573741353061&amp;#038;q=NYSE:+NEWM&amp;#038;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRozi3w8sc9YSm9SWtOXmPU4OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLiYoOyBKT4uHj00_UNq4yKC4wtcot5FrFy-UUGu1op-LmG-wIAtgFITEkAAAA&amp;#038;biw=1290&amp;#038;bih=1310&amp;#038;dpr=2"&gt;NEWM&lt;/a&gt;, GateHouse&amp;#8217;s holding company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both said yes. &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/11/14/gannett-new-media-investment-group-merger-vote-results/2578352001/"&gt;NEWM&amp;#8217;s board went first&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;#8220;Precise vote totals were not immediately available, but New Media CEO Mike Reed said that about 99% of the 75% of shareholders who voted approved the deal.&amp;#8221; Then the results of Gannett&amp;#8217;s vote was announced at 10 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They approved the deal despite the value of the deal plummeting since it was first announced. On that day in August, NEWM shares stood at $10.70. At market close yesterday, they&amp;#8217;d dropped to $6.68, including a six percent decline on Wednesday alone. The deal originally valued at $1.38 billion is now worth $1.13 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the drop? Some investors looking at the deal had hoped it would fail and thought they could catch a NEWM bounce; perhaps some abandoned the stock as the merger became a near-certainty. Perhaps you can blame McClatchy, the next largest newspaper chain, for souring the market; its stock dropped 12 percent yesterday after it &lt;a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/business/article237316284.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the IRS had denied its request for pension fund funding relief. (It&amp;#8217;s down 22 percent since Friday.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it was just the accumulated toll of poor earnings reports from both GateHouse and Gannett. Or did major NEWM investor Leon Cooperman&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2019/11/01/nobody-believes-gannett-gatehouse-merger.html"&gt;pooh-poohing&lt;/a&gt; of New Gannett&amp;#8217;s projections — &amp;#8220;nobody believes any of the numbers coming out&amp;#8221; — convince others to get out? (Cooperman&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878329/billionaire-leon-cooperman-hurt-by-elizabeth-warrens-new-billionaireblasting-ad"&gt;been in the news lately&lt;/a&gt; for other reasons.) Gannett&amp;#8217;s USA Today &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/11/13/gannett-new-media-investment-group-combination/2560751001/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that some &amp;#8220;large investors in New Media appear to have sold off shares earlier this week.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure that some combination of all those explanations is at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, life, such as it is in the daily industry, goes on. Following today&amp;#8217;s votes, expect the deal to formally close — and New Gannett to become a corporate reality — on November 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry watchers, then, will have their eyes on the next announcement, expected on or around the next day, November 20. That&amp;#8217;s when CEO &lt;a href="https://www.newmediainv.com/about-us/"&gt;Mike Reed&lt;/a&gt; and Gannett operating head &lt;a href="https://www.gannett.com/who-we-are/leadership-team/Paul-Bascobert/"&gt;Paul Bascobert&lt;/a&gt; will name their new executive team. Today I can offer a likely preview of who&amp;#8217;ll ascend in the new Gannett order. Before that, though, let&amp;#8217;s break down this megamerger as it concludes — and then take a look at what&amp;#8217;s likely for the company that will operate 18 percent of America&amp;#8217;s daily newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, let&amp;#8217;s start with some news: the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; big newspaper M&amp;#038;A deal, which I can now report is (once again) in progress. McClatchy and Tribune executives are talking about merging their two companies, I&amp;#8217;ve confirmed with several sources. While I don&amp;#8217;t expect any imminent announcements, both companies&amp;#8217; executives agree that, in this rapidly deteriorating operating environment, a merger that buys time by massively cutting costs is a first order of 2020 business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the companies decline comment on what would be the next largest — and most logical — remaining combination, it&amp;#8217;s clear what obstacles will need to be cleared to pull it off. Let&amp;#8217;s call them the two Fs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first F: &lt;em&gt;Financing&lt;/em&gt;. McClatchy and Tribune will argue that adding the two companies together, likely creating synergies in the $200 million-plus range, will create a less leveraged, financially healthier company. But can they get the financing to get the deal done, given the limited interest most banks are showing in the industry? And if they do, can get they get it at an interest rate of lower than the 11.5 percent that New Gannett is paying Apollo Global Capital for its $1.8 billion in financing. (Remember, the need to pay back that loan quickly is a big driver of New Gannett&amp;#8217;s ever-increasing cuts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second F: &lt;em&gt;Ferro&lt;/em&gt;. Michael Ferro, the former Tronc/Tribune board chair, nixed the last attempt at a McClatchy/Tribune combo last December. His group still holds 25 percent of Tribune, and they could once again stand in the way of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the ground — that gyrating retail ground in all the 38 McClatchy and Tribune markets, — revenue declines worsen, and the worries about 2020 deepen. Tribune, in last week&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://investor.tribpub.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tribune-publishing-reports-third-quarter-2019-results"&gt;quarterly earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, said ad revenues were down 15 percent — in both print and digital — with total revenues down 7.7 percent. McClatchy, in its &lt;a href="https://investors.mcclatchy.com/static-files/400d64d3-dd72-4863-bd92-936d063fabe4"&gt;earnings report Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, said ad revenues were down 19.3 percent, with total revenues down 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, McClatchy has to deal with its ongoing pension plan problems, now &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcclatchy-seeks-to-have-u-s-take-over-pension-fund-11573672133?mod=searchresults&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;pos=1"&gt;negotiating&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;a distressed termination&amp;#8221; with the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Though it was able to report in &lt;a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/business/article237316284.html"&gt;first gain&lt;/a&gt; in quarterly EBITDA in eight years, the stress on the company is clearly intensifying. It reported that the money it owes the pension &amp;#8220;greatly exceeds the company’s anticipated cash balances and cash flow given the size of its operations relative to the obligations due, and creates a significant liquidity challenge in 2020.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://investor.tribpub.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tribune-publishing-announces-quarterly-cash-dividend-program"&gt;Tribune announced this morning&lt;/a&gt; that it would begin issuing a quarterly cash dividend for shareholders. And not a cheap one: $0.25 per share, per quarter. With &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TPCO/key-statistics?p=TPCO"&gt;36.02 million shares of stock outstanding&lt;/a&gt;, that adds up to about $36 million per year going to shareholders — despite the company being in the red by $9.1 million for the first three quarters of 2019. As &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5a2a520f-23b1-38ef-9687-bdd3d0847405/tribune-publishing-to-start.html"&gt;MarketWatch notes&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;a dividend yield of 10.47%, compared with the implied yield for the S&amp;#038;P 500 of 1.92%.&amp;#8221; That might attract cashflow-hungry investors but it also removes $36 million a year that could go toward investing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleagues have to chose between keeping their job &amp;amp; having health care because they literally cannot afford the increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put it all together and the &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/01/newsonomics-let-the-2019-consolidation-games-begin-first-up-alden-seeks-to-swallow-gannett/"&gt;2019 Consolidation Games&lt;/a&gt;, first previewed here in January, are set to extend into the new decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The megamerger will win headlines with the vote today and then the closing next week, but the focus will likely shift to the substantial head-rolling. That&amp;#8217;s understandable, as these employees sadly find themselves joining tens of thousands of others who have departed the newspaper industry in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest question, though, is what the deal will come to mean for American local journalism, and that&amp;#8217;s the big picture we&amp;#8217;ll be looking out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know that the deal of Mike Reed&amp;#8217;s career will focus first on both rapid reduction of his huge debt and the maintenance/improvement of the dividend that has sustained NEWM investment over the years. A lot of New Gannett&amp;#8217;s cashflow will be exiting through one of those two doors. How much will remain to pay journalists and essential product people in 2020, 2021 and into 2022 — to invest in the product — is the big unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subhead"&gt;How did we get here?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last December, Gannett CEO Bob Dickey surprised his colleagues by announcing his retirement. The company was caught unprepared, with no likely internal successor in view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smelling opportunity, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alden_Global_Capital"&gt;Alden Global Capital&lt;/a&gt; president Heath Freeman — proprietor of the shapeshifting chain &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_First_Media"&gt;MNG&lt;/a&gt;, successor in various ways to MediaNews Group, Digital First Media, Journal Register, and 21st Century Media — made his move. He &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/01/newsonomics-let-the-2019-consolidation-games-begin-first-up-alden-seeks-to-swallow-gannett/"&gt;offered to buy Gannett&lt;/a&gt;. Though both his intentions and access to financing remained suspect, the Gannett board and management edged toward panic. Could storied Gannett — founded 1923, the largest U.S. newspaper publisher, second to News Corp globally — be swallowed up by a hedge fund that had become the poster child for &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/newsonomics-do-newspaper-companies-have-a-strategy-beyond-milking-papers-for-profit/"&gt;milking the U.S. press&lt;/a&gt; on its way toward oblivion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Gannett pondered its options in fighting Alden — resulting in a later board battle and more — Mike Reed smelled both opportunity and the whiff of panic. He called Gannett, offering GateHouse as a friendlier merger partner. Reed looked great compared to Heath Freeman, Gannett executives said to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of valuing, negotiating, and comfort-seeking followed through the year. In the end, though, that&amp;#8217;s how private equity &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_Investment_Group"&gt;Fortress Investment Group&lt;/a&gt; has come to control and manage the biggest daily newspaper chain in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#8217;s consider the numbers, the people, and the decisions ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subhead"&gt;The numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big number is that synergy number, now sitting at $400 million or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Reed has said editorial cuts would be minimal, &amp;#8220;there&amp;#8217;s no way they can get that number without significant newsroom cuts,&amp;#8221; one person very close to the deal told me. Other sources have echoed that belief. With headcount amounting to about 50 percent of total expense, most are placing the overall number of FTE cuts at more than 3,000. Some believe the number, over the next year, will come in at somewhere between 3,500 and 4,000. It&amp;#8217;s unlikely we&amp;#8217;ll know the actual number for awhile, and then only through extrapolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a sense of scale, when this deal closes, McClatchy will be the second largest U.S. newspaper company by circulation, behind New Gannett. It has &lt;a href="https://investors.mcclatchy.com/static-files/400d64d3-dd72-4863-bd92-936d063fabe4"&gt;fewer than 2,800 employees&lt;/a&gt; in total. So New Gannett will cut more jobs — perhaps &lt;em&gt;substantially&lt;/em&gt; more — than its biggest competitor even has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why has the number grown from the $275 million to $300 million first cited by Reed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, undoubtedly: Operating revenue keeps getting worse, quarter by quarter. And it may be that even Reed doesn&amp;#8217;t want to bet on the highly optimistic revenue forecasts he has &lt;a href="https://investors.gannett.com/sites/gannett.investorhq.businesswire.com/files/doc_library/file/nt10004306x5_424b3_NewMedia__E_bookproof.pdf"&gt;offered investors in his merger prospectus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was on GateHouse&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4301846-new-media-investment-group-inc-newm-ceo-mike-reed-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single"&gt;earning call&lt;/a&gt; last week that  Leon Cooperman made mincemeat of Reed&amp;#8217;s numbers. In colorful language rarely seen on the by-the-book quarterly financial result conference calls, Cooperman laid into those forecasts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I listen to you, Mike, on the call, I&amp;#8217;m reminded of the deceased comedian, Rodney Dangerfield, who used to complain he gets no respect. And, so I look at &lt;a href="https://investors.gannett.com/sites/gannett.investorhq.businesswire.com/files/doc_library/file/nt10004306x5_424b3_NewMedia__E_bookproof.pdf"&gt;page 88 of the S4&lt;/a&gt;, the proxy statement that came out and connects with the merger. And if I take the numbers there, the stock is presently trading at 2.7&amp;times; EBITDA. And this assumption, so nobody believes the numbers, no, on the resized dividend, the stock gives 9%, you&amp;#8217;re 2.7&amp;times; EBITDA. In 2021, you&amp;#8217;re going to fix the financing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody believes it. And I think part of the problem is Gannett&amp;#8217;s total revenues have been declining at over 9% over the past few quarters. New Media&amp;#8217;s revenues have been declining at around 7%. In fact, I think the Q3 was 7.9%. Post-merger, you&amp;#8217;re projecting declines 3.5% in 2020, 1.5% in 2021 and down 0.4% in 2022. As regards margins, they&amp;#8217;re running 11% to 12% currently. Post-merger, you&amp;#8217;re expecting 15.6%, 18.6%, 21.3%, &amp;#8217;20, &amp;#8217;21, &amp;#8217;22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can understand the margin expansion stemming from the synergies, but I don&amp;#8217;t understand how we go from revenue declines that are 7% or 8% to 3% or 4%. What is behind that and how confident they are that this is going to be the case?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Ouch. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/elizabeth-warren-blasts-billionaires-in-campaign-ad-calling-for-wealth-tax.html"&gt;Elizabeth Warren isn&amp;#8217;t the only one&lt;/a&gt; getting &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2019/11/06/elizabeth-warren-leon-cooperman"&gt;Cooperman&amp;#8217;s toughest&lt;/a&gt; these days.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Reed emphasized the minimizing of the part of the business going south the fastest — print advertising — and the increased focus on growth areas. He also highlighted the events production business &lt;a href="http://gatehouselive.com/"&gt;GateHouse Live&lt;/a&gt;, a fast-growing, high-margin unit that will be brought as quickly as possible to Gannett markets. (&amp;#8220;So 85% of our revenues will be driven by categories that we feel we can have either stable or growing,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;So we feel very confident over the three-year period that the biggest driver of declines, print advertising, will be a very small portion of our overall business.&amp;#8221;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a simple truism applies here. If you have a number to hit, it&amp;#8217;s far easier to get there by cutting expenses than to really rely on improved revenues. Cutting big and cutting deep at the outset offers Reed some insurance. That way, he knows he&amp;#8217;ll be able to pay off the Apollo debt and maintain investor dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Cooperman&amp;#8217;s astute skepticism, he&amp;#8217;s maintained his support of the merger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? The same reason I&amp;#8217;ve repeated throughout the year: No one loves this deal, but it is probably the best that can done now to possibly salvage investors&amp;#8217; stakes. That&amp;#8217;s what I hear from those in and around it. For publicly traded, &lt;a href="https://www.dummies.com/business/operations-management/classes-of-stock-shares-in-a-business/"&gt;single-class&lt;/a&gt; newspaper companies — a species that night not survive the 2020s — it&amp;#8217;s all about the art of the imminently possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll learn more about this merger as numbers tumble out through 2020, in quarterly reports and SEC filings. How much will the company pay out early in the year to some of the passed-over Gannett and GateHouse executives, who&amp;#8217;ll be deploying their golden parachutes? How many tens of millions will be paid out in severance to generate those huge cost savings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how does the combined company actually perform? It will take as long as 15 months to get a true apples-to-apples comparison on revenues and profits. In the interim, it&amp;#8217;s a lot of extrapolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the numbers junkies out there, the &lt;a href="http://newsguild.org/mediaguild3/"&gt;NewsGuild&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://buildingtheguild.org/project/tony-daley/"&gt;Tony Daley&lt;/a&gt;, a research economist, has written an exhaustive account of the GateHouse/Fortress timeline, with &lt;a href="http://newsguild.org/mediaguild3/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Statement-on-GateHouse-Gannett-Merger.pdf"&gt;lots of data&lt;/a&gt;. The guild, newly energized by the wave of unionization spreading across digital media, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/08/gannett-merger-nears-completion-union-claims-deal-threatens-journalism/"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; its own denunciation of the megamerger last week, saying &amp;#8220;journalism will suffer.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subhead"&gt;The people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s the figures and facts, and then there&amp;#8217;s the people — and the gnarlier question of culture. GateHousers pride themselves on moving fast, breaking things, and getting things done. Gannetteers point to the greater sophistication of their systems and processes and their deeper benches of talent. Expect those benches to thin quickly, given the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already within Gannett, sources say, business managers have gotten the message and are picking up the pace. Soon they&amp;#8217;ll see how many of them survive to work on the always-tough process of merging two companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top executives will try to do what they can to reduce how long that process takes, but everyone expects it to take something like 18 to 24 months to unwind, rewind, and combine how things work. All that is an opportunity cost — potentially productive time and resources that are devoted more to internal change than external business management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the new top management. Sources tell me the new lineup is fairly clear, but it could still change before announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve already known that Paul Bascobert would become New Gannett&amp;#8217;s operating CEO, reporting to Reed. Accepting Bascobert, who was just hired by Gannett this summer, was part of the deal to which Reed agreed. That meant that Reed&amp;#8217;s longtime business partner, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirkdavis12/"&gt;Kirk Davis&lt;/a&gt;, would not move into the same No. 2 post at the new company. Davis, well-liked by his management troops and respected as a leading operator in revenue performance in the industry, has &lt;a href="https://www.telegram.com/news/20191031/davis-to-leave-gatehouse-and-new-media-after-gannett-deal-closes"&gt;decided to leave the company&lt;/a&gt; rather than take on a lesser position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, perhaps, in a merger driven by GateHouse, a number of Gannett executives appear positioned to take big roles at the merged company. In fact, some in GateHouse find the amount of Gannett influence in the new company disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several top Gannett executives are expected to assume similar positions in the new company, say several sources. Current Gannett CFO Alison Engel is one. (New Media &lt;a href="https://www.newmediainv.com/about-us/#exec"&gt;currently lists its CFO&lt;/a&gt; as &amp;#8220;TBD.&amp;#8221;) In the all-important revenue leadership position, Gannett chief revenue officer/ USA Today Network Marketing Solutions head &lt;a href="https://www.gannett.com/who-we-are/leadership-team/Kevin-Gentzel/"&gt;Kevin Gentzel&lt;/a&gt; will move into that bigger job with the new company. Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.gannett.com/who-we-are/leadership-team/Maribel-Wadsworth/"&gt;Maribel Wadsworth&lt;/a&gt;, currently president of USA Today Network and publisher of USA Today, &amp;#8220;oversee[ing] the company&amp;#8217;s consumer business,&amp;#8221; will take on a similar role at New Gannett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From GateHouse, &lt;a href="http://www.gatehousemedia.com/2017/07/11/denise-robbins-named-new-senior-vice-president-of-consumer-marketing/"&gt;Denise Robbins&lt;/a&gt;, SVP of consumer marketing, is expected to take a similar job. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-taylor-043738a9/"&gt;Jason Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, who heads up GateHouse&amp;#8217;s new ventures unit, including GateHouse Live, will maintain a similar portfolio, sources tell me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subhead"&gt;The decisions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all the pressures on the companies and the industry, lots is on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in 2020, the company will decide which of its newspaper properties to sell or swap. &amp;#8220;Asset sales&amp;#8221; are a key part of the Q1 agenda — though I don&amp;#8217;t expect major sales, just some one-offs. Reed will also get cash for some of the remaining real estate that Gannett brings into the deal, much of which came with its own acquisitions over the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do know something about what the parties have valued as they put the deal together. Gannett&amp;#8217;s national digital ad network is one of those, bringing in plus revenue for the company, sources say. Adding GateHouse&amp;#8217;s digital audience to that network will add scale, and scale is good. Likewise, expect to see that USA Today&amp;#8217;s branding extended across all the sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will USA Today the newspaper continue publication? At Poynter, Rick Edmonds has &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2019/is-usa-todays-print-edition-headed-for-the-sunset-as-gatehouse-and-gannett-merge-signs-point-to-yes/"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; the likely approach of its end of print. How long that&amp;#8217;ll take will likely be the question. In the meantime, its branding, ironically, will be ascendant. And that leaves big questions about Gannett&amp;#8217;s national journalism staff. With a large Washington bureau and USA Today&amp;#8217;s staff, where do those journalists fit in the new company&amp;#8217;s strategy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also know, as noted above, that GateHouse Live is highly valued and will be extended to Gannett properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how will the various digital marketing companies of both Gannett and GateHouse be combined? And can the company find ways to improve margins in this once-highly-touted growth business that has produced disappointing cashflow for many publishers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bascobert has outlined a &amp;#8220;marketplaces&amp;#8221; strategy in his early visits to company cities. Bascobert, previously of &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paul-bascobert-joins-xo-group-as-president-of-local-marketplace-300324276.html"&gt;The Knot/XO Group&lt;/a&gt;, has told staffers he sees such marketplaces as a new central point of rebuilding the local commercial advertising business. In the months ahead, we&amp;#8217;ll see what kinds of marketplaces New Gannett will test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are the regional design centers. Gannett has operated several of them; GateHouse has largely centralized its page makeup and production work in Austin. Those centers have already eliminated lots of news production jobs at local papers. How much more can their work be rationalized, squeezed, or made &amp;#8220;more efficient&amp;#8221;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, that&amp;#8217;s the all-encompassing question here. Neither of these two companies are known for excess or big spending, in their journalism or elsewhere. They&amp;#8217;ve both already been well squeezed, for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much juice is left to extract? And when the juicing is done, what&amp;#8217;s left for the readers? Money for journalism: That&amp;#8217;s still the root question here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of millions have gone out to Fortress Investment over the years, and there are still tens of millions left to go, as Fortress serves out its final two-year management contract and then exits with a new package of shares worth tens of millions more. That&amp;#8217;s money that, like GateHouse&amp;#8217;s dividends, hasn&amp;#8217;t paid and won&amp;#8217;t pay for journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How questionable are those payments, even within the traditional private equity world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take it from Leon Cooperman — as hard-boiled a capitalist as they come — who had his own comment on the matter on GateHouse&amp;#8217;s earnings call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know we&amp;#8217;re happy to get rid of Fortress, but I got to tell you, and I probably shouldn&amp;#8217;t say this but I will say it, because that&amp;#8217;s my nature of speaking what&amp;#8217;s on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I was in the hedge fund business for 26 years. I only got paid when I made money for investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of money that Fortress is walking away here with, and I know it&amp;#8217;s not your doing. They brought this public in 2014 at $16 a share. The stock is $8.50, and they&amp;#8217;re going to walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars. It&amp;#8217;s just morally wrong, and they shouldn&amp;#8217;t even take the money, given what they&amp;#8217;ve done here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr style="clear: both; margin: 0 0 24px;"&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          It’s been just over a year since I sat in the hearing room and watched the final act of Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing. I listened from the back as Christine Blasey Ford and then-Judge Kavanaugh each faced the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell irreconcilable versions of what happened in the summer of 1982. The morning was spent as I’d anticipated: all of us—the press corps, the country—listening, some clearly in agony, to Ford’s account. And then Kavanaugh came in and started screaming. The reporters at the tables around me took him in with blank shock, mindlessly typing the words he was yelling.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          The enduring memory, a year later, is that my 15-year-old son texted—he was watching it in school—to ask if I was “perfectly safe” in the Senate chamber. He was afraid for the judge’s mental health and my physical health. I had to patiently explain that I was in no physical danger of any kind, that there were dozens of people in the room, and that I was at the very back, with the phalanx of reporters. My son’s visceral fears don’t really matter in one sense, beyond the fact that I was forced to explain to him that the man shouting about conspiracies and pledging revenge on his detractors would sit on the court for many decades; and in that one sense, none of us, as women, was ever going to be perfectly safe again.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          Kavanaugh is now installed for a lifetime at the highest court in the land. Ford is &lt;a class="external" href="https://msmagazine.com/2019/10/09/setting-the-record-straight-dr-christine-blasey-fords-legal-team-speaks-out/" rel="nofollow"&gt;still unable to resume her life or work for fear of death threats&lt;/a&gt;. And the only thing the hearings resolved conclusively is that Senate Republicans couldn’t be bothered to figure out what happened that summer of 1982, or in the summers and jobs and weekends that followed. In the year-plus since, I have given many speeches in rooms full of women who still have no idea what actually happened in that hearing room that day, or why a parody of an FBI investigation was allowed to substitute for fact-finding, or why Debbie Ramirez and her Yale classmates were never even taken seriously, and &lt;a class="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/006286291X/?tag=slatmaga-20" rel="nofollow"&gt;why&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/059308439X/?tag=slatmaga-20" rel="nofollow"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0525560343/?tag=slatmaga-20" rel="nofollow"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; so far and &lt;a class="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1982123869/?tag=slatmaga-20" rel="nofollow"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am-b0e16cc1-d2d6-466a-89f7-3ab78b97149c.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; books to come are doing the work of fact-finding that government couldn’t be bothered to undertake. Women I meet every week assure me that they are never going to feel perfectly safe again, which makes my son somewhat prescient. Two out of the nine sitting justices have credibly been accused of sexual impropriety against women. They will be deciding fundamental questions about women’s liberty and autonomy, having both vowed to get even for what they were “put through” when we tried to assess whether they were worthy of the privilege and honor of a seat on the highest court in the country.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;As a Supreme Court reporter, I am also expected to afford the new justice that same generosity and solicitude. As a journalist, I am finding it hard to&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;do.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          My job as a Supreme Court reporter used to be to explain and translate the institution to people locked out of its daily proceedings. I did that reasonably well for 19 years, I suppose. Years upon years of sometimes partisan, often political brawling, from &lt;em&gt;Bush v. Gore&lt;/em&gt; to the Affordable Care Act to &lt;em&gt;Obergefell&lt;/em&gt;—and abortion, yes. But always swathed in black robes and velvet curtains, in polite questions, and case names and at least the appearance that this was all cool science, as opposed to blood sport.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          What I have not acceded to is the routinization and normalization of the unprecedented seat stolen from President Barack Obama in 2016 for no reason other than Mitch McConnell wanted it, and could. And what I have also not acceded to is the routinization and normalization of an unprecedented seating of someone who managed to himself evade the very inquiries and truth-seeking functions that justice is supposed to demand. And so, while I cannot know conclusively what happened in the summer of 1982, or at the sloppy drunk parties in the years that followed at Yale, or in the &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2019/09/17/8-close-to-home-revelations-in-the-new-brett-kavanaugh-book/" rel="nofollow"&gt;falling-down summer evenings at tony D.C. law firms&lt;/a&gt;, or with the gambling debts, or with the leaked Judiciary Committee emails, I can say that given Senate Republicans’ refusal to investigate, acknowledge, or &lt;em&gt;even turn over&lt;/em&gt; more than 100,000 pages of documents relating to Kavanaugh, it is surely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; my job to, in the parlance of Justice Antonin Scalia, America’s favorite grief counselor, “get over it.”
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          The American public seems to be getting over the Kavanaugh hearings. New &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/10/04/supreme-court-remains-respected-despite-kavanaugh-turmoil/" rel="nofollow"&gt;polling certainly suggests as much&lt;/a&gt;. And, having spent the bulk of last term lying low &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/kavanaugh-allegations-agitate-white-house-capitol-supreme-court-is-quiet/2019/09/16/ad670b44-d8a0-11e9-ac63-3016711543fe_story.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;both doctrinally and also publicly&lt;/a&gt;, Kavanaugh appears to be ready to emerge now, in the form of a soaring Federalist Society butterfly. By his watch, apparently, it’s time, and so he will be a &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/10/21/federalist-society-event-will-feature-kavanaugh-gorsuch-and-a-raft-of-trump-appointed-judges/" rel="nofollow"&gt;featured speaker at the swanky Federalist Society dinner next month&lt;/a&gt; (tickets are $250 for nonmembers and $200 for members). William Barr’s Justice Department last week awarded the “&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/10/24/barrs-justice-dept-honors-kavanaugh-team-at-private-ceremony/?kw=Barr%27s%20Justice%20Dept.%20Honors%20Kavanaugh%20Team%20at%20Private%20Ceremony&amp;amp;utm_source=email&amp;amp;utm_medium=enl&amp;amp;utm_campaign=breakingnews&amp;amp;utm_content=20191024&amp;amp;utm_term=nlj" rel="nofollow"&gt;Attorney General’s Award for Distinguished Service&lt;/a&gt;,” the department’s &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-award.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;second highest honor&lt;/a&gt;, to the team of attorneys that worked on Kavanaugh’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;nomination last year. It was a closed ceremony.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/kavanaugh-allegations-agitate-white-house-capitol-supreme-court-is-quiet/2019/09/16/ad670b44-d8a0-11e9-ac63-3016711543fe_story.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Two of the three women justices spoke out this summer to support their new colleague&lt;/a&gt;. They hailed him as a mentor to his female clerks or as a collegial member of the Nine and urged us, in the case of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, to look to the future and turn the page. It is, of course, their actual job to get over it. They will spend the coming years doing whatever they can to pick off a vote of his, here and there, and the only way that can happen is through generosity and solicitude and the endless public performance of getting over it. I understand this.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          As a Supreme Court reporter, I am also expected to afford the new justice that same generosity and solicitude. As a journalist, I am finding it hard to do. After all, he is a man who has already publicly condemned his critics to suffer his wrath for embarrassing him. He is a man who has promised that his doubters and detractors will “reap the whirlwind.” He should know full well that after such behavior, he will be celebrated as a hero by some, and he should understand that for millions of others, the choice will be whether to let him back into the centrist, reasonable D.C. insider fold or to push him to become what Clarence Thomas became after his own hearings: a vengeance machine that neither forgives nor forgets. Nobody other than the most radical conservative wants another vengeance machine on the high court, not one who could otherwise be a fifth vote on occasion. So the name of the game is forgiveness and forgetting, in service of long-term tactical appeasement.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          That is the problem with power: It incentivizes forgiveness and forgetting. It’s why the dozens of ethics complaints filed after the Kavanaugh hearings complaining about the judge’s behavior have been easily buried in a bottomless file of appeasement, on the grounds that he’s &lt;a class="external" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/supreme-court-brett-kavanaugh-misconduct-complaints.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;been seated and it’s too late&lt;/a&gt;. The problem with power is that there is no speaking truth to it when it holds all the cards. And now, given a lifetime appointment to a position that is checked by no one, Washington, the clerkship machinery, the cocktail party circuit, the elite academy all have a vested interest in getting over it and the public performance of getting over it. And a year perhaps seems a reasonable time stamp for that to begin.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          The problem with power is that Brett Kavanaugh now has a monopoly on normalization, letting bygones be bygones, and turning the page. American women also have to decide whether to get over it or to invite more recriminations. That is, for those keeping track, the very definition of an abusive relationship. You stick around hoping that he’s changed, or that he didn’t mean it, or that if you don’t anger him again, maybe it’ll all be fine when the court hears the game-changing abortion appeal this year.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          I wish we could have learned what Brett Kavanaugh has actually done, said, worked on, enabled, covered for, empowered. Perhaps the next book will reveal more. Perhaps the one after that. The collective public conclusion of the most recent book, by Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, seems to be that he was a sloppy, reckless, drunk youth who has largely become better, and that it is perhaps unfair to hold men to standards that we somehow always forgive when they are still boys. We didn’t get to have that conversation either. And the people who most deserve to decide whether he is, in fact, cured of these alleged acts of youthful carelessness, violence, and predation—the women who say he has harmed them—have, other than Ford, neither been heard nor recognized. I’m not certain they subscribe to the narrative that he was a naughty boy now recovered. He spent his confirmation hearing erasing them, and his boosters and fans have made their lives since unbearable. At any rate, they are also powerless, now, to change what has occurred.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          It is not my job to decide if Brett Kavanaugh is guilty. It’s impossible for me to do so with incomplete information, and with no process for testing competing facts. But it’s certainly not my job to exonerate him because it’s good for his career, or for mine, or for the future of an independent judiciary. Picking up an oar to help America get over its sins without allowing for truth, apology, or reconciliation has not generally been good for the pursuit of justice. Our attempts to get over CIA torture policies or the Iraq war or anything else don’t bring us closer to truth and reconciliation. They just make it feel better—until they do not. And we have all spent far too much of the past three years trying to tell ourselves that everything is OK when it most certainly is &lt;a class="external" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/10/sarah-pitlyk-judge-nomination-anti-abortion-activist-trump.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;not normal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="external" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/family-separation-is-horrifying-but-we-cant-go-numb-and-turn-away.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;not OK&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="external" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/demoralizing-reality-of-life-under-trump.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;not worth getting over&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
          I haven’t been inside the Supreme Court since Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed. I’ve been waiting, chiefly in the hope that at some point I would get over it, as I am meant to do for the good of the courts, and the team, and the ineffable someday fifth vote which may occasionally come in exchange for enough bonhomie and good grace. There isn’t a lot of power in my failing to show up to do my job, but there is a teaspoon of power in refusing to normalize that which was simply wrong, and which continues to be wrong. I don’t judge other reporters for continuing to go, and I understand the ways in which justices, judges, law professors, and clerks must operate in a world where this case is closed. Sometimes I tell myself that my new beat is justice, as opposed to the Supreme Court. And my new beat now seems to make it impossible to cover the old one.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And sure, let accountability fall on PG&amp;amp;E, the California Public Utilities Commission, and whomever else. The problem is far, far deeper though, and it extends way beyond the local situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A kind of toxic debt is embedded in much of the infrastructure that America built during the 20th century. For decades, corporate executives, as well as city, county, state, and federal officials, not to mention voters, have &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/the-impact/failure-to-act-report/" rel="nofollow"&gt;decided against doing the routine maintenance and deeper upgrades&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that electrical systems, roads, bridges, dams, and other infrastructure can function properly under a range of conditions. Kicking the can down the road like this is often seen as the profit-maximizing or politically expedient option. But it’s really borrowing against the future, without putting that debt on the books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In software development, engineers have long noted that taking the easy way out of coding problems builds up what they call “technical debt,” as the &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2019/10/18/a-world-we-built-to-burn/" rel="nofollow"&gt;tech journalist Quinn Norton has written&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Like other kinds of debt, this debt compounds if you don’t deal with it, and it can distort the true cost of decisions. If you ignore it, the status quo looks cheaper than it is. At least until the off-the-books debt comes to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;PG&amp;amp;E’s balance sheets are now fully on view, thanks to the company’s massive liabilities from recent fires, which have &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/pgechapter11/" rel="nofollow"&gt;landed it in bankruptcy court&lt;/a&gt;. Pressed by new climatic conditions, PG&amp;amp;E’s system has entered a new era. Utility officials have admitted that large-scale power shutoffs—during which tens or hundreds of thousands of people lose power for days—will be a regular feature of fall life for &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/us/pge-power-shut-off-fires-ten-years/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;a decade&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing as the company is in bankruptcy, it will probably &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/business/9978607-181/pge-monthly-rates-may-rise" rel="nofollow"&gt;keep asking&lt;/a&gt; to raise rates. So it’s likely that PG&amp;amp;E customers will be living with higher rates, rolling blackouts, and the possibility of power lines starting new fires. And that’s the optimistic scenario, which assumes that the company can actually scrape together enough money to upgrade its system. No matter what decisions anyone makes now, everyone hooked up to the grid in Northern California is likely going to receive worse service even as we all collectively pay more to harden the system against fire. This is what runaway technical debt looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/californias-power-outage/599935/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Annie Lowrey: Alone in the dark in the Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Almost everywhere you look in the built environment, toxic technical-debt bubbles are growing and growing and growing. This is true of privately maintained systems such as PG&amp;amp;E’s and publicly maintained systems such as that of &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2019/02/07/great-lakes-water-shutoffs" rel="nofollow"&gt;Chicago’s Department of Water Management&lt;/a&gt;. It’s extremely true of roads: Soon, &lt;a class="external" href="https://thenearlynow.com/breaking-roads-making-bank-85a442d0e2f9" rel="nofollow"&gt;perhaps 50 percent of Bay Area roads&lt;/a&gt; will be in some state of disrepair, not to mention the deeper work that must occur to secure the roadbeds, not just the asphalt on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Then there are the sewers and the wastewater plants. Stormwater drains. Levees. And just regular old drinking water. Per capita federal funding for water infrastructure &lt;a class="external" href="http://thevalueofwater.org/media/raising-bar-federal-investments-water-infrastructure" rel="nofollow"&gt;has fallen precipitously since the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;. Cities are forced to make impossible decisions between funding different services. And even when they do have the money they need, officials make bad or corrupt decisions. So, water systems in the United States have built up a &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.nrdc.org/media/2018/180514" rel="nofollow"&gt;$1 trillion technical debt&lt;/a&gt;, which must be paid over the next 25 years. The problem is particularly acute in the Great Lakes states. &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2019/02/07/great-lakes-water-shutoffs" rel="nofollow"&gt;One investigation, by American Public Media&lt;/a&gt;, found that from 2007 to 2018 Chicago residents’ water bills tripled, and Cleveland residents’ doubled. In Detroit, a city with a median income of less than $27,000, the average family paid $1,151 for water. At these rates, poor residents are far more likely to have their water shut off, and the systems still aren’t keeping up with the maintenance they need. Runaway technical debt makes it nearly impossible to pay the “interest,” which is just keeping the system running, let alone to start paying down the principal or start new capital projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>I bet you could've guessed Equifax's username and password...</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thechangelog/~3/-HHyayc8TwQ/1185234246471958528" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2019-10-29T15:57:30Z</updated><author><name>Jerod Santo</name></author><id>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thechangelog/~3/-HHyayc8TwQ/1185234246471958528</id><summary type="html">&lt;table style="border: 1px solid #E0E0E0; margin: 0; padding: 0; background-color: #F0F0F0" valign="top" align="left" cellpadding="0" width="100%"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JaneLytv"&gt;Jane Lytvynenko&lt;/a&gt; went digging through &lt;a href="https://t.co/SBDumoufDf?amp=1"&gt;the Equifax class-action suit&lt;/a&gt; and uncovered some absolute &lt;em&gt;gems&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Equifax employed the username “admin” and the password “admin” to protect a portal used to manage credit disputes, a password that “is a surefire way to get hacked.” This portal contained a vast trove of personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor"&gt;Hanlon’s razor&lt;/a&gt; often applies in security breaches like these, but I can’t see this as anything but &lt;em&gt;pure negligence&lt;/em&gt; by Equifax’s technical teams. There’s more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equifax also failed to encrypt sensitive data in its custody… admitted that sensitive personal information relating to hundreds of millions of Americans was not encrypted… Not only was this information unencrypted, but it was also accessible through a public-facing, widely used website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months ago, in Hong Kong for International Business, Stick a Fork in It, we predicted the slow demise of Hong Kong as an international business center. Many wrote us to say they agreed. Many wrote us to say they vehemently disagreed. Those who disagreed argued that we had underestimated the grit and the resilience of the people in Hong Kong. My general response was to say that I truly appreciate that grit and resilience, but that it would be no match for the much greater power of Mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our previous post stated the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure why nobody has just come out and said this yet, but Hong Kong as an international business and financial center is no more. I take no comfort in saying this because I have many friends in Hong Kong and I&amp;#8217;ve always loved going there, but Hong Kong&amp;#8217;s special position is over. Kaput. Fini. Terminado. &lt;span lang="zh-CN"&gt;完. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="ru"&gt;законченный. Done. Over. No more. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="ru"&gt;I challenge you to say &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/06/21/one-country-two-systems-lots-of-problems/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one country two systems&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; with a straight face.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;For the last few months I have been relentlessly asking everyone I know in Hong Kong or who used to be in Hong Kong or who at one time contemplated setting up a business in Hong Kong how what has been happening in Hong Kong has and will or would impact their doing business in Hong Kong. Based on those responses and on my own experience with how international companies operate, I foresee the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 60px;"&gt;&amp;#8212; Companies that were deciding between Hong Kong or Singapore for their Asian headquarters will choose somewhere other than Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 60px;"&gt;&amp;#8212; Growing companies with offices in Hong Kong and with offices somewhere else in Asia will increase their hiring outside Hong Kong and decrease or eliminate their hiring in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 60px;"&gt;&amp;#8212; Companies with offices in Hong Kong and with offices somewhere else in Asia will be move personnel from their Hong Kong office to their other offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 60px;"&gt;&amp;#8212; Fewer contracts will be drafted with Hong Kong as the venue for arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 60px;"&gt;&amp;#8212; Companies will move their Hong Kong bank accounts elsewhere. It is no coincidence HSBC stock hit its 52 week low today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 60px;"&gt;&amp;#8212; Travelers will choose somewhere other than Hong Kong as their Asia stopover. It is no coincidence Cathay Pacific stock hit its 52 week low today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 60px;"&gt;&amp;#8212; Many Hong Kongers will eventually go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;saying any of the above will be noticeable tomorrow or even a month from now, but I am saying that all of the above have already begun and all of the above will accelerate once China&amp;#8217;s army goes in at full force, which is pretty much inevitable. Within two years Hong Kong will be a very different place than it is today and within five years it will hardly be recognizable for those of us who have been there within the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went on to discuss how we have been &amp;#8220;relentlessly downbeat about the US-China trade war&amp;#8221; and its impacts as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;Way back in October 2018, we called the US-China trade war &lt;a href="https://www.chinalawblog.com/2018/10/china-the-united-states-and-the-new-normal.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the &amp;#8220;New Normal&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://www.chinalawblog.com/2018/10/would-the-last-company-manufacturing-in-china-please-turn-off-the-lights.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Would the Last Company Manufacturing in China Please Turn Off the Lights, &lt;/a&gt;we forecast an inevitable sharp decline in China manufacturing. On May 8, 2019, in &lt;a href="https://www.chinalawblog.com/2019/05/the-us-china-cold-war-starts-now-what-you-must-do-to-prepare.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The US-China Cold War Starts Now: What You Must do to Prepare, &lt;/a&gt;we warned of a &amp;#8220;straight line decline in US-China relations&amp;#8221; and we laid out what businesses should do in response to that. Long before that, my law firm brought on &lt;a href="https://harrisbricken.com/directory/?fwp_position=3" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three additional sourcing experts &lt;/a&gt;experienced with product sourcing from Southeast Asia and with other countries outside China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then noted how many do not appreciate our gloomy predictions but that telling the truth as we see it is our job here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;Our gloomy predictions have angered many, and I get it. What we are saying is not pleasant, especially for those with companies or livelihoods that depend on free trade with China or on Hong Kong remaining as Asia&amp;#8217;s leading business hub. But please understand that we are only calling things as we see them, not as we want them to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then advocated for businesses preparing for a new and different and decidedly worse Hong Kong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;As for Hong Kong, we are now suggesting our clients (and you) (1) consider places like Singapore and &lt;a href="https://www.chinalawblog.com/2018/11/doing-business-outside-china-its-thailands-time.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; as your Hong Kong replacement, (2) implement plans for evacuating your Hong Kong personnel, (3) cease using Hong Kong arbitration clauses (except with Hong Kong companies), and (4) avoid going there unless truly necessary. If corporate responsibility or data protection are at the core of your business, your Hong Kong decisions are more pressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing about Hong Kong again because twice in the last two weeks I have sat next to someone on an airplane with major Hong Kong connections and I had hours to talk to them about Hong Kong, and those conversations &amp;#8212; along with everything else we have been seeing and hearing over the last few months &amp;#8212; all confirm that Hong Kong is indeed over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hearing all that we have predicted, but one thing we did not quite predict is the growing animosity between Hong Kong and the Mainland. Three months ago, we were not sure what efforts the PRC would make to &amp;#8220;preserve&amp;#8221; Hong Kong, and it is now looking like the answer is very little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been consistently hearing of all that we predicted above and more, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&amp;#8212; Going to Hong Kong on the way to the PRC is likely to subject you to increased scrutiny when you arrive in the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&amp;#8212; Companies looking to form WFOEs in China are telling us they have heard that using a Hong Kong entity to own the WFOE is now a &amp;#8220;bad idea.&amp;#8221; Our China WFOE lawyers have not actually seen this to be the case, and even those who tell us this do not have any real evidence to back it up, but just the fact so many believe this is telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&amp;#8212; Some of our own clients are saying they do not want to use Hong Kong arbitration clauses any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&amp;#8212; Many airlines have eliminated flights to Hong Kong and &amp;#8212; near as I can tell &amp;#8212; all have greatly reduced their fares on their remaining Hong Kong flights. I have heard countless stories of near-empty flights to Hong Kong and of how incredibly easy it is now to get bumped up to Business Class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&amp;#8212; A number of Hong Kong law firms have told me that their business is way down, &amp;#8220;for obvious reasons.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&amp;#8212; Foreigners with kids are leaving or looking to leave in droves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whither Hong Kong. . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are you seeing out there? What do you see happening out there? Anyone have real evidence that we are wrong on this? Oh, and just for the record, I love Hong Kong and I take zero joy from its unraveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do local public radio stations play an important role? In big cities, from Boston and Washington to San Francisco and L.A.? In small towns, like those across Mississippi or Alaska or Maine? Do they matter in the South as well as the North? In inland states as well as those on the coast?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the evidence I’m aware of, anecdotal &lt;a href="https://www.journalism.org/fact-sheet/public-broadcasting/"&gt;and statistical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cpb.org/aboutpb/rural"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that in every one of these places, the answer is a clear and obvious &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;i&gt;es&lt;/i&gt;. Public radio matters; it matters all the more in remote and rural areas further from other news outlets; and it is seen as mattering in a way that transcends normal regional or political dividing-lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But suppose those public-radio hosts, programs, and stations were judged not by their broadest social, civic, and cultural effects but instead by the narrowest financial measures. How many would pass muster if they were held as part of a private-equity fund’s portfolio, in which each program or local station stayed in operation only as long as its return-on-equity matched that of some alternative investment, from a big construction project or a biotech start-up firm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those circumstances, virtually none of the stations could exist. Nor would any library. Or public park. Or museum. Or zoo. Or virtually any educational institution except for the shadiest diploma-mills. Or any of the other aspects of social life whose “returns” may be enormous but are not captured in one investor’s profit-and-loss sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a way of understanding the predicament of local newspapers, in a private-equity age. And it’s a reminder that a specific business model, and a broader public interest, can be fundamentally at odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously small-town papers face a hyper-intense version of the pressures affecting the news business as a whole. But previously in this series we’ve discussed local papers that are for now defying the harsh economic trends—in &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/05/future-local-journalism-case-study-mississippi/588865/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/08/local-local-local-how-a-small-newspaper-survives/595900/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/theres-hope-for-local-journalism/598225/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, aspirationally in Southern California, and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/06/report-america-revives-possibilities-local-journalism/591817/?utm_source=feed"&gt;in points beyond&lt;/a&gt;. More reports are ahead—from Tennessee, from Michigan, from northern California, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central message in all these reports has been that &lt;i&gt;ownership structure matters&lt;/i&gt;. If papers are owned by private-equity based firms, of which the most familiar examples are the &lt;a href="https://www.medianewsgroup.com/"&gt;MediaNews Group&lt;/a&gt; (better known by the trade name Digital First Media) and &lt;a href="http://www.gatehousemedia.com/"&gt;GateHouse Media&lt;/a&gt;, the prospects for community news are grim. The chains are in the news business as “just another business,” and their coast-to-coast track record is of squeezing the reporting and editing budget until there is nothing left that subscribers would want to pay for. But in the same market where a private-equity-owned paper would be doomed, some family- or community-owned papers have shown that they can make “enough” money to keep providing the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the little Massachusetts town of Harvard, about 30 miles northwest of Harvard University, in Cambridge, but with no connection to it. It is the latest arena of attempts to create a paper that can be sustainable, on non-private-equity business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 6,000 people now live in Harvard, Massachusetts (which I feel compelled to keep identifying that way, to avoid confusion with the “other” place). In the mid-1800s, it was a haven for transcendentalists, Shakers, and other spiritually minded New England Utopians. One of its current tourist attractions is its &lt;a href="https://fruitlands.thetrustees.org/"&gt;Fruitlands Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which tells the story of some of these groups. In modern times Harvard’s main business has been farming, especially apple-growing, plus spillover from nearby Fort Devens, until it began shutting down as part of the base-closing movement of the 1990s. It also now serves as a bedroom community, within reasonable commuting range of Cambridge and Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="u-block-center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="383" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/10/70_Fruitlands_ni/6384c8229.jpg" width="538" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;The Fruitlands Museum in winter (&lt;a href="http://www.lisaa2z.com"&gt;Lisa Aicukewz&lt;/a&gt; / Harvard Press)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in the early 1970s, Harvard, Mass. had a local paper called &lt;i&gt;The Harvard Post&lt;/i&gt;, founded by, among others, a civic activist and news entrepreneur named Ed Miller, then in his 20s. This is the same Ed Miller who, now in his early 70s, has just founded a local weekly for Cape Cod, as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/09/theres-hope-for-local-journalism/598225/?utm_source=feed"&gt;I described last month&lt;/a&gt;. In 1978, Miller, his &lt;i&gt;Post&lt;/i&gt; co-founder Kathleen Cushman, and Lawrence Anderson &lt;a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/how-to-produce-a-small-newspaper-kathleen-cushman/1102938267"&gt;wrote a how-to book&lt;/a&gt; on the art and science of successfully running small papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;i&gt;Post&lt;/i&gt; served Harvard, Mass. for 30 years as a locally owned community newspaper, it was unexpectedly sold&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;in 2003 to a chain called Community News Company, or CNC. For a little while CNC kept the paper’s journalistic and civic role mostly intact. But soon the cutbacks began, the local coverage thinned out, and local readership waned. The paper’s office was moved out of town to a regional center; CNC itself became part of GateHouse; and by 2013, long after &lt;a href="https://www.harvardpress.com/About-the-Press/Circulation-Statistics"&gt;it had ceased&lt;/a&gt; to be a significant part of local affairs, &lt;i&gt;The Harvard Post&lt;/i&gt; officially shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their existing paper caved in—really, as it was dismantled by design—four local residents decided to take matters into their own hands, and to start a paper to play the part that the &lt;i&gt;Post&lt;/i&gt; had in its pre-chain days. One of the four, Worth Robbins, explained &lt;a href="https://www.harvardpress.com/ARTICLES/ArtMID/4508/ArticleID/1561"&gt;on the website&lt;/a&gt; of the new paper, &lt;i&gt;The Harvard Press&lt;/i&gt;, what happened next. The chain-owned &lt;i&gt;Post&lt;/i&gt;, he said, “stopped being a local paper, by and for Harvard residents.” And in response:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harvard Press was born when four Harvard residents decided to band together to produce a high-quality, locally owned newspaper, like the town once had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early October 2006, we put finishing touches on a rudimentary business plan with assumptions about subscriptions and advertising (the two sources of revenue for any newspaper), and cost estimates for equipment, printing, and distribution. We would operate initially in the home of one of the partners…The owners/partners would take token compensation for the first year. The business plan projected a first-year deficit in the range of $50,000 to $100,000; we would need financial help to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided not to organize as a nonprofit, because of inherent constraints. We wanted the paper to be fully independent, free to engage with the town without restriction; therefore support contributions would not be tax-deductible, nor would they confer any special privileges or influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expected it would take several months to attract contributions to enable us to get started, and initial plans called for a January 2007 launch. We were fortunate, however, to receive significant support from a small number of longtime residents, who shared our belief that Harvard needed a good local newspaper. Less than a week after we began looking for help, we had received commitments for enough money to begin, and we set November 17, 2006 as the target for the first issue—less than six weeks away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened since then is chronicled in a large number of update posts, mainly by Worth Robbins, collected in &lt;a href="https://www.harvardpress.com/About-the-Press/The-Economics-of-Local-News"&gt; “The Economics of Local News&lt;/a&gt; series at &lt;i&gt;The Harvard Press’s&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.harvardpress.com/"&gt;main web site&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also analyzed in &lt;a href="https://thepolitic.org/local-journalism-a-labor-of-love-and-democracy/"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in the Yale journal &lt;a href="https://thepolitic.org/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Politic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;by Lily Moore-Eissenberg, who grew up in Harvard, Mass. and was a high-school reporter for the &lt;i&gt;Press&lt;/i&gt; before going to college at Yale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short version of these accounts is: the&lt;i&gt; Press&lt;/i&gt; has operated on a shoestring, with borrowed and donated equipment and low-paid or volunteer labor; it has steadily increased its role and presence in the town, now with paid distribution to over two-thirds of the town’s households; and having operated it for more than a dozen years, its owners are now considering how to make it viable for the long haul.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of us who started the paper and are still here are in our 70s,” Worth Robbins told me, when I spoke with him on the phone last month. “We’re doing it for love of community. We’re not going to keep doing this forever. People are being paid, but not a lot. So we want not only to put the paper on a sound financial footing—and be prepared to pay more meaningful salaries, to attract younger people to work here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="u-block-center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="353" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/10/Carlsons_peachfest_394501/90ae100c7.jpg" width="496" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Harvard residents stand in line during the annual peach festival at Carlson Orchards (&lt;a href="http://www.lisaa2z.com"&gt;Lisa Aicukewz&lt;/a&gt; / Harvard Press)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robbins said that the paper’s staff had made a point of including and training students and young people from the community. But he and his colleagues realize that to entice any young resident to return, the paper would need a different business basis. And so they were trying to move from just-enough community funding to survive, to a large enough budget to allow the paper to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Three years ago, I put a story in the paper saying, &lt;em&gt;We’re getting low on funds, we could use some help&lt;/em&gt;,” he told me, “One person wrote in saying, &lt;em&gt;I love the paper, and I’ll put in $5,000 to match $100 donations from other people.&lt;/em&gt;” That campaign led to about $12,000 in total donations. “Then we came up with this idea of ‘sustaining subscribers,’” he told me. “People who would pay $100 per year, rather than $30 or $40—and if they could pay for five years, at $500, in advance, please do so!” Since the beginning of the sustaining-subscriber campaign, the paper has gotten about 240 people to support at that level, “and 40 of them for five years!” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Robbins—who grew up in Kentucky, and came to Harvard, Mass. in the 1970s for a tech career—what difference it had made to his community when it lost its paper, and as one has re-emerged. “The town was so damaged by the loss of the &lt;i&gt;Post&lt;/i&gt;,” he told me. “We’ve lived through the experience of having a great paper, and losing it, and we do not want to let that happen again.” Thus the multi-front drive for “sustaining” subscriptions, for a website with frequent updates—and a paywall (the historical items mentioned above are in a non-paywall section), and for events &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/harvard-press-speaker-series-tina-cassidy-with-charlie-sennott-tickets-73125886495"&gt;like one this coming weekend&lt;/a&gt;, in which former &lt;i&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt; reporter Tina Cassidy will speak with Charles Sennott, also formerly of the &lt;i&gt;Globe&lt;/i&gt; and now head of the &lt;a href="https://thegroundtruthproject.org/team/charlie_sennott/"&gt;GroundTruth Project&lt;/a&gt;. (Sennott is also co-founder, with Steven Waldman, of the ambitious new Report for America project, which &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/06/report-america-revives-possibilities-local-journalism/591817/?utm_source=feed"&gt;I wrote about&lt;/a&gt; this past summer.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What difference will that make? Robbins gave the example of the &lt;a href="https://harvardpress.com/ARTICLES/ArticleID/17074/TitleLink/Hundreds-turn-out-for-Town-Meeting-to-approve-new-elementary-school-26-million-budget-and-more/ArtMID/4508"&gt;town’s decision last year&lt;/a&gt; on whether to spend nearly $50 million on elementary school construction. “There was tremendous controversy and consternation,” he said. “The previous school was only 30 years old, and many people were upset. We did an incredibly good job of covering all aspects of the issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="left"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="397" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/10/2017_July_4th_8053/1fa6b510f.jpg" width="332" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Antique cars drive down a Harvard road for the annual July 4th parade (&lt;a href="http://www.lisaa2z.com"&gt;Lisa Aicukewz&lt;/a&gt; / Harvard Press)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have read through many of the &lt;i&gt;Press &lt;/i&gt;stories in issues leading up to the town-meeting vote this spring, and I agree. The tradeoffs and implications involved in the budget choices were laid out with great clarity and care. An in-person vote of citizens at a town meeting would decide the issue. “Usually 300 or 400 people is the most you’d ever see at a meeting,” Robbins told me. But for the vote, in May of last year, nearly 1,100 people showed up—and approved the spending by the required two-thirds majority. “Of course I’m biased, but I think a lot of the outcome was due to the depth and scope of coverage we had in the paper,” Robbins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By email I asked Charles Sennott whether, as a resident of the town, he agreed with this assessment. “Yes,” he wrote back, the paper “did exemplary work on its coverage of the big vote, truly small town New England newspapering at its very best.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;The Harvard Press’s&lt;/em&gt; answer “the” answer for all struggling local papers? Of course not. It’s up to the people of Harvard, Mass. to see whether they can keep this model of journalism going even in their one community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is one answer, for one town, and the moment, and in these times each such answer deserves attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/ourtowns?utm_source=feed"&gt;More from this series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>One Brother Stabbed the Other.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Biancardi wrote about how the court had ruled against him. That drew attention from others who asked for articles about themselves to be taken down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those demands was from Vittorio Pecoraro, now in his 80s, who was stabbed by his brother, Umberto, in the 2008 seaside restaurant brawl. The brothers were arrested after the fight. Assault-related charges against Vittorio Pecoraro were effectively dropped when the authorities did not pursue them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vittorio Pecoraro sued Mr. Biancardi, citing the right to be forgotten. Mr. Biancardi refused to remove the article. The story had been based on information from the police, he said. Nothing was factually wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Vittorio Pecoraro argued that his privacy had been violated. The article was easily available and searchable online, and he had not been convicted of a crime. Yet because of PrimaDaNoi, what he considered a humiliating family argument had become the first thing that many people knew about him and his pizza and seafood restaurant, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a reputation, I have been here for 50 years, I am known all over,” Mr. Pecoraro said in an interview at the restaurant, Positano, where the 2008 fight had occurred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyer, Paolo Sardini, said Google was not targeted because the article was Mr. Biancardi’s responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Umberto Pecoraro’s son, Vincenzo, said his father declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, an Italian judge ruled in favor of Vittorio Pecoraro and ordered PrimaDaNoi to delete its stabbing story, saying the information in it was old and no longer in the public interest. (Mr. Pecoraro didn’t ask for another PrimaDaNoi article about the incident to be deleted because it didn’t rank high in Google’s search results for his restaurant.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Eighteen is History</title><link href="http://feeds.dashes.com/~r/AnilDash/~3/wTRTNcE7elI/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2019-09-22T22:49:19Z</updated><author><name>Anil Dash</name></author><id>http://feeds.dashes.com/~r/AnilDash/~3/wTRTNcE7elI/</id><summary type="html">&lt;table style="border: 1px solid #E0E0E0; margin: 0; padding: 0; background-color: #F0F0F0" valign="top" align="left" cellpadding="0" width="100%"&gt;

For them, the attacks are only history; that's all they ever were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can sort of understand it. I was born after Vietnam, after Watergate. But my whole childhood, these were the points of reference, the milestones used to justify choices or underpin arguments. They were totems, symbols, history. &lt;em&gt;Only&lt;/em&gt; history, not something real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And these days I spend a lot of time with people for whom 9/11 is only history. Someone who is as old today as I was that day would probably have been shielded from knowing too much at the time. They'd have been as young as my son is today, and I still shield him from the full weight of my memories of that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankly, that's hard for me to process. We still ground so much of our social and political rhetoric in that day, so it's easy for me to forget that for many (for &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt;?), it's only a signifier, with none of the visceral evocations of memory. I remember how 9/11 smelled. I remember how my city smelled, for months. I can still look up at a clear blue sky with the slightest breeze in the air and imagine that morning, and remember when the wind shifted and the plume came over our neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it's up to me to let it go. To let it become history. I don't mind that younger people don't have the same reverence for the moment. Maybe I'm kind of glad they don't. I can see now what I couldn't see then. Those of us who witnessed that day, even if only in a small way, will fade from the cultural conversation. When I was young, you would still hear people talk about D Day, or Pearl Harbor. Being young and insolent, I never had much patience for listening to the stories. Young people don't have reverence for these moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess we said we'd never forget. But the consensus around grief, around memorial, around observance — that fragile fiction faded by the time the smell dissipated. We didn't get around to deciding what it was, exactly, that we were Never Forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, we ended up with this legacy. There are ritualized remembrances, largely led by those who weren't there, those who mostly hate the values that New York City embodies. The sharpest memories are of the goals of those who masterminded the attacks. It's easy enough to remember what they wanted, since they accomplished all their objectives and we live in the world they sought to create. The empire has been permanently diminished. Never Forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I still maintain a little bit of hope. Because just as a new generation doesn't revere the memories of those of us okd enough to bear witness, they are also not despairing over the failures of our follow-up. This is the world they've always lived in, the starting point they were always given. So there was never anything other than moving forward from that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="in-past-years"&gt;In Past Years&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year I write about the attacks on this anniversary, to reflect both on that day and where I'm at right now. I also deeply appreciate the conversation that ensues with those who check in with me every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://anildash.com/2018/09/11/seventeen-is-almost-just-another-day/"&gt;Seventeen is (Almost) Just Another Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I spent so many years thinking “I can’t go there” that it caught me completely off guard to realize that going there is now routine. Maybe the most charitable way to look at it is resiliency, or that I’m seeing things through the eyes of my child who’s never known any reality but the present one. I'd spent a lot of time wishing that we hadn't been so overwhelmed with response to that day, so much that I hadn''t considered what it would be like when the day passed for so many people with barely a notice at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, &lt;a href="https://anildash.com/2017/09/11/sixteen_is_letting_go_again/"&gt;Sixteen is Letting Go Again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;So, like ten years ago, I’m letting go. Trying not to project my feelings onto this anniversary, just quietly remembering that morning and how it felt. My son asked me a couple of months ago, “I heard there was another World Trade Center before this one?” and I had to find a version of the story that I could share with him. In this telling, losing those towers was unimaginably sad and showed that there are incredibly hurtful people in the world, but there are still so many good people, and they can make wonderful things together.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, &lt;a href="https://anildash.com/2016/09/11/fifteen_is_the_past/"&gt;Fifteen is the Past&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I don’t dismiss or deny that so much has gone so wrong in the response and the reaction that our culture has had since the attacks, but I will not forget or diminish the pure openheartedness I witnessed that day. And I will not let the cynicism or paranoia of others draw me in to join them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I’ve realized, simply, is that 9/11 is in the past now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, &lt;a href="http://anildash.com/2015/09/11/fourteen_is_remembering/"&gt;Fourteen is Remembering&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For the first time, I clearly felt like I had put the attacks firmly in the past. They have loosened their grip on me. I don’t avoid going downtown, or take circuitous routes to avoid seeing where the towers once stood. I can even imagine deliberately visiting the area to see the new train station.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, &lt;a href="http://anildash.com/2014/09/11/thirteen_is_understanding/"&gt;Thirteen is Understanding&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There’s no part of that day that one should ever have to explain to a child, but I realized for the first time this year that, when the time comes, I’ll be ready. Enough time has passed that I could recite the facts, without simply dissolving into a puddle of my own unresolved questions. I look back at past years, at my own observances of this anniversary, and see how I veered from crushingly sad to fiercely angry to tentatively optimistic, and in each of those moments I was living in one part of what I felt. Maybe I’m ready to see this thing in a bigger picture, or at least from a perspective outside of just myself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2013, &lt;a href="http://anildash.com/2013/09/11/twelve_is_trying/"&gt;Twelve is Trying&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I thought in 2001 that some beautiful things could come out of that worst of days, and sure enough, that optimism has often been rewarded. There are boundless examples of kindness and generosity in the worst of circumstances that justify the hope I had for people’s basic decency back then, even if initially my hope was based only on faith and not fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is also fatigue. The inevitable fading of outrage and emotional devastation into an overworked rhetorical reference point leaves me exhausted. The decay of a brief, profound moment of unity and reflection into a cheap device to be used to prop up arguments about the ordinary, the everyday and the mundane makes me weary. I’m tired from the effort to protect the fragile memory of something horrific and hopeful that taught me about people at their very best and at their very, very worst.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, &lt;a href="https://anildash.com/2012/09/11/eleven_is_what_we_make/"&gt;Eleven is What We Make&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;These are the gifts our children, or all children, give us every day in a million different ways. But they’re also the gifts we give ourselves when we make something meaningful and beautiful. The new World Trade Center buildings are beautiful, in a way that the old ones never were, and in a way that’ll make our fretting over their exorbitant cost seem short-sighted in the decades to come. More importantly, they exist. We made them, together. We raised them in the past eleven years just as surely as we’ve raised our children, with squabbles and mistakes and false starts and slow, inexorable progress toward something beautiful.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011 for the 10th anniversary, &lt;a href="http://anildash.com/2011/09/11/ten_is_love_and_everything_after/"&gt;Ten is Love and Everything After&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I don’t have any profound insights or political commentary to offer that others haven’t already articulated first and better. All that I have is my experience of knowing what it mean to be in New York City then. And from that experience, the biggest lesson I have taken is that I have the obligation to be a kinder man, a more thoughtful man, and someone who lives with as much passion and sincerity as possible. Those are the lessons that I’ll tell my son some day in the distant future, and they’re the ones I want to remember now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, &lt;a href="https://anildash.com/2010/09/11/nine_is_new_new_york/"&gt;Nine is New New York&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]his is, in many ways, a golden era in the entire history of New York City.&lt;br /&gt;Over the four hundred years it’s taken for this city to evolve into its current form, there’s never been a better time to walk down the street. Crime is low, without us having sacrificed our personality or passion to get there. We’ve invested in making our sidewalks more walkable, our streets more accommodating of the bikes and buses and taxis that convey us around our town. There’s never been a more vibrant scene in the arts, music or fashion here. And in less than half a decade, the public park where I got married went from a place where I often felt uncomfortable at noontime to one that I wanted to bring together my closest friends and family on the best day of my life. We still struggle with radical inequality, but more people interact with people from broadly different social classes and cultures every day in New York than any other place in America, and possibly than in any other city in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all of this happened, by choice, in the years since the attacks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, &lt;a href="http://anildash.com/2009/09/11/eight_is_starting_over/"&gt;Eight Is Starting Over&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]his year, I am much more at peace. It may be that, finally, we’ve been called on by our leadership to mark this day by being of service to our communities, our country, and our fellow humans. I’ve been trying of late to do exactly that. And I’ve had a bit of a realization about how my own life was changed by that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking to my mother last week, I offhandedly mentioned how almost all of my friends and acquaintances, my entire career and my accomplishments, my ambitions and hopes have all been born since September 11, 2001. If you’ll pardon the geeky reference, it’s as if my life was rebooted that day and in the short period afterwards. While I have a handful of lifelong friends with whom I’ve stayed in touch, most of the people I’m closest to are those who were with me on the day of the attacks or shortly thereafter, and the goals I have for myself are those which I formed in the next days and weeks. i don’t think it’s coincidence that I was introduced to my wife while the wreckage at the site of the towers was still smoldering, or that I resolved to have my life’s work amount to something meaningful while my beloved city was still papered with signs mourning the missing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, &lt;a href="https://anildash.com/2008/09/11/seven_is_angry/"&gt;Seven Is Angry&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Finally getting angry myself, I realize that nobody has more right to claim authority over the legacy of the attacks than the people of New York. And yet, I don’t see survivors of the attacks downtown claiming the exclusive right to represent the noble ambition of Never Forgetting. I’m not saying that people never mention the attacks here in New York, but there’s a genuine awareness that, if you use the attacks as justification for your position, the person you’re addressing may well have lost more than you that day. As I write this, I know that parked out front is the car of a woman who works in my neighborhood. Her car has a simple but striking memorial on it, listing her mother’s name, date of birth, and the date 9/11/2001.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, &lt;a href="https://anildash.com/2007/09/11/six_is_letting_go/"&gt;Six Is Letting Go&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;On the afternoon of September 11th, 2001, and especially on September 12th, I wasn’t only sad. I was also hopeful. I wanted to believe that we wouldn’t just Never Forget that we would also Always Remember. People were already insisting that we’d put aside our differences and come together, and maybe the part that I’m most bittersweet and wistful about was that I really believed it. I’d turned 26 years old just a few days before the attacks, and I realize in retrospect that maybe that moment, as I eased from my mid-twenties to my late twenties, was the last time I’d be unabashedly optimistic about something, even amidst all the sorrow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, &lt;a href="https://anildash.com/2006/09/11/after-five-years-failure/"&gt;After Five Years, Failure&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[O]ne of the strongest feelings I came away with on the day of the attacks was a feeling of some kind of hope. Being in New York that day really showed me the best that people can be. As much as it’s become cliché now, there’s simply no other way to describe a display that profound. It was truly a case of people showing their very best nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We seem to have let the hope of that day go, though.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, &lt;a href="https://anildash.com/2005/09/11/four_years/"&gt;Four Years&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw people who hated New York City, or at least didn’t care very much about it, trying to act as if they were extremely invested in recovering from the attacks, or opining about the causes or effects of the attacks. And to me, my memory of the attacks and, especially, the days afterward had nothing to do with the geopolitics of the situation. They were about a real human tragedy, and about the people who were there and affected, and about everything but placing blame and pointing fingers. It felt thoughtless for everyone to offer their response in a framework that didn’t honor the people who were actually going through the event.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, &lt;a href="https://anildash.com/2004/09/11/thinking_of_you/"&gt;Thinking Of You&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I don’t know if it’s distance, or just the passing of time, but I notice how muted the sorrow is. There’s a passivity, a lack of passion to the observances. I knew it would come, in the same way that a friend told me quite presciently that day back in 2001 that “this is all going to be political debates someday” and, well, someday’s already here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, &lt;a href="https://anildash.com/2003/09/11/two_years/"&gt;Two Years&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I spent a lot of time, too much time, resenting people who were visiting our city, and especially the site of the attacks, these past two years. I’ve been so protective, I didn’t want them to come and get their picture taken like it was Cinderella’s Castle or something. I’m trying really hard not to be so angry about that these days. I found that being angry kept me from doing the productive and important things that really mattered, and kept me from living a life that I know I’m lucky to have.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, I wrote &lt;a href="https://anildash.com/2018/03/04/on_being_an_ame/"&gt;On Being An American&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]n those first weeks, I thought a lot about what it is to be American. That a lot of people outside of New York City might not even recognize their own country if they came to visit. The America that was attacked a year ago was an America where people are as likely to have been born outside the borders of the U.S. as not. Where most of the residents speak another language in addition to English. Where the soundtrack is, yes, jazz and blues and rock and roll, but also hip hop and salsa and merengue. New York has always been where the first fine threads of new cultures work their way into the fabric of America, and the city the bore the brunt of those attacks last September reflected that ideal to its fullest.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, &lt;a href="https://anildash.com/2001/09/11/thank_you/"&gt;Thank You&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I am physically fine, as are all my family members and immediate friends. I’ve been watching the footage all morning, I can’t believe I watched the World Trade Center collapse…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been sitting here this whole morning, choking back tears… this is just too much, too big. I can see the smoke and ash from the street here. I have friends of friends who work there, I was just there myself the day before yesterday. I can’t process this all. I don’t want to.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AnilDash/~4/wTRTNcE7elI" width="1" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1505189303763-99eacdbca050?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" /&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>At Boston Public Schools, even the city’s most politically connected can get the runaround</title><link href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/09/18/boston-public-schools-even-city-most-politically-connected-can-get-runaround/mnD24vphPh7EIQipaHHX8N/story.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2019-09-19T12:49:21Z</updated><id>https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/09/18/boston-public-schools-even-city-most-politically-connected-can-get-runaround/mnD24vphPh7EIQipaHHX8N/story.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;table style="border: 1px solid #E0E0E0; margin: 0; padding: 0; background-color: #F0F0F0" valign="top" align="left" cellpadding="0" width="100%"&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But once she got there, a very apologetic school staff informed her that he was not on its list and — making matters worse — the school system’s registration offices didn’t open until noon. After spending an hour at the school trying to sort through the mess, Wu left with her son — another victim of the chaotic Boston school registration system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get Metro Headlines in your inbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 10 top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wu took to Twitter to vent her frustrations, writing “special guest with me at City Hall today due to BPS limbo.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most frustrating part was that I was afraid this would happen &amp;amp; asked several times on the phone with &lt;a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/BostonSchools" rel="nofollow"&gt;@BostonSchools&lt;/a&gt; on Monday if I could get any confirmation that Blaise was all set — an email? A number? Anything?” she wrote as she was heading to her weekly City Council meeting. No, she said she was told, just show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wu’s experience highlights the kinds of frustrations families endure as they attempt to navigate the city’s Byzantine student assignment system, which allows families to choose from a customized list of schools based on their home address but offers no guarantee they will receive any of their picks. The situation is even more precarious for families vying for prekindergarten, where hundreds of children are waitlisted every year with no clear indication they will ever be assigned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families have often complained that they receive conflicting information from &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/09/05/late-registrations-complicate-start-school-for-many-boston-families/qRrDKIBAeXU8RTmfO9Vb6J/story.html?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" rel="nofollow"&gt;school registration sites&lt;/a&gt;, and the process is cumbersome, requiring families to sign up in person and produce an array of documents, from proof of residency to child immunization records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The school system defended its communication practices with families.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Boston Public Schools always strives to communicate clearly, consistently, and accurately with families,” Dan O’Brien, a school spokesman, said in a statement. “In this isolated instance, there was a human error that led to a miscommunication. Our staff responded swiftly to bring an immediate resolution to this issue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wu, in an interview, said she and her husband are lucky they can make their schedules work when a snafu like Wednesday morning’s arises, but she added, “Many other families can’t have last-minute instability and that you can’t rely on what you are told in an enrollment system — that is pretty archaic.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her City Hall office Wednesday afternoon looked almost like a makeshift daycare with brightlycolored Mega Legos scattered across the floor as Blaise built a tower with them and later pulled out a stack of children’s books from a shelf to read. Earlier, he endured a City Council meeting, where he sat with Councilor Kim Janey and drew pictures. He was still wearing his new long-sleeved white polo shirt with “Charles Sumner Elementary School” printed on the front.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One floor below, Wu’s youngest son, Cass, 2, was in the actual City Hall daycare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The registration snafu was short-lived. Wu received an e-mail from the Sumner’s principal before the City Council meeting began, informing her that the registration was complete and that Blaise could return to school.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wu said she appreciated the effort everyone made, from the school secretary to the principal, to resolve the issue. The Sumner was her top choice: She and her husband like the sense of community there, and it’s a short walk from their Roslindale home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beliza Veras-Moriarty, a Boston school parent who served recently on the superintendent search committee, said she was not surprised by Wu’s mishap. Six years ago, she missed a single phone call from the school system informing her a slot had become available for her son at Boston Arts Academy, but the family was on vacation at the time while she also was juggling a newborn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I called back and the seat was taken away,” she said. “My son was heartbroken.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the end, it worked out for her son, who wanted to be an artist and graduated from Fenway High School with a full scholarship to MassArt. But Veras-Moriarty said the school system could do a better job of communicating and working with families. “I feel like they beat you down so you don’t say anything,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This wasn’t the first time Wu has turned to social media to raise concerns about the assignment system. She voiced disappointment this spring when Blaise did not get assigned to any of the eight or nine schools they applied to, noting “a system that creates winners &amp;amp; losers out of our families is one that’s failing our city as a whole.” She echoed similar concerns a year earlier when she unsuccessfully tried getting Blaise into a preschool program for 3-year-olds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other city councilors have also voiced concerns about the student assignment system. Council President Andrea Campbell in releasing her education plan in June called on the school system to make the registration centers more welcoming and to simplify the school assignment process while also increasing access to quality schools to families of all backgrounds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The central office has to do a much better job in meeting the needs of families,” Campbell said. “Good communication is essential. Parents have a lot going on.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Vaznis can be reached at &lt;a class="external" href="mailto:james.vaznis@globe.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;james.vaznis@globe.com&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;hr style="clear: both; margin: 0 0 24px;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that local newspapers are in trouble. That’s why Deb Fallows and I have been chronicling examples of smaller papers that have bucked the economic trend—in &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/05/future-local-journalism-case-study-mississippi/588865/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/08/local-local-local-how-a-small-newspaper-survives/595900/?utm_source=feed"&gt;coastal Maine&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/06/report-america-revives-possibilities-local-journalism/591817/?utm_source=feed"&gt;rural communities&lt;/a&gt; across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what “everyone knows” about the main source of the problem may be wrong—or misleading enough to divert attention away from a possible solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conventional view of the local-journalism crisis is that running a small-town newspaper just isn’t a viable business any more—now that the internet advertising has drained off revenue, and now that virtual communities and social media have displaced real-world connections and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those pressures are all too real. (Sobering details on the collapse of ad revenue &lt;a href="https://www.journalism.org/fact-sheet/newspapers/"&gt;are here&lt;/a&gt;.) But some of the remaining success stories in this troubled field suggest that the &lt;em&gt;ownership structure &lt;/em&gt;of local news organizations may matter as much as internet-era advertising shifts, in determining which organizations survive and which perish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short: Increasing evidence suggests that the local newspaper business may still be viable, simply as a business. What it can no longer do is provide the super-profit levels that private equity groups expect from their holdings, and that they demand as a condition of letting the papers exist. Papers that are doomed under private-equity ownership might have a chance in some different economic structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This proposition—that newspaper ownership is as important as internet-era advertising trends, in deciding local journalism’s future—was examined at length in a &lt;a href="https://prospect.org/article/saving-free-press-private-equity"&gt;2017 article in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/article/saving-free-press-private-equity"&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Robert Kuttner and Hildy Zenger (the latter a pen name). It has been a theme connecting our previous newspaper-survivor reports, from Maine to Mississippi. And it is the idea behind a new weekly print newspaper whose first edition came off the presses this month, in Provincetown, Massachusetts, at the tip of Cape Cod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-established paper for “Outer Cape Cod,” the communities from Provincetown southward, was the &lt;em&gt;Provincetown Banner&lt;/em&gt;, founded before the Civil War. In 2008, the &lt;em&gt;Banner &lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://plymouth.wickedlocal.com/article/20080229/NEWS/302299961"&gt;was sold to&lt;/a&gt; GateHouse Media Inc., a private-equity-run chain of mainly smaller papers across the country. Long-established newspaper chains like Gannett, Knight Ridder, and McClatchy have their problems and detractors. But their goal, as Kuttner and Zenger pointed out in their &lt;em&gt;Prospect&lt;/em&gt; piece, was fundamentally to &lt;em&gt;operate newspapers&lt;/em&gt;. Their operations paid at least lip-service to the idea that newspapers had a civic and community role, beyond their sheer economic existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modern trend in small-paper ownership is their takeover by private-equity firms, of which Alden Global Capital, its subsidiary MediaNews Group (formerly known as Digital First Media), and GateHouse are the best-known examples. For these institutions, newspapers are a financial asset like any other—like a tract of commercial real estate, like a steel mill or a suburban mall. The profit-maximizing model they have applied to countless small papers has been: slashing costs, mainly by laying off reporters and editors, so as to boost short-term profit rates; continuing the cutbacks, so as to maintain profit margins, even as a thinner paper attracted fewer readers and ads; and when there was nothing left to cut, declaring bankruptcy or closing the paper, which had in strictly financial terms reached the end of its useful life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Banner&lt;/em&gt;, in its GateHouse years, has gone through a version of this cycle. (For the record: I have called and sent messages to relevant GateHouse officials, and will report back if I hear from them.) At the time of its sale, it had a staff of about 20. By early this year, the staff was down to four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people think about corporate ownership of newspapers, they think the problem is that the company is telling you what to write—like Sinclair, with its broadcast stations,” Ed Miller, a &lt;a href="http://www.openuniversityofwellfleet.org/ed-miller.html"&gt;long-time newspaper entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt; who worked as an editor at the &lt;em&gt;Banner&lt;/em&gt; starting in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact is, they couldn’t care less what you write,” he said. “Their only interest is how much profit you can squeeze out of the operation, so the way they actually undermine the reporting of news is simply by laying off staff. The cuts make the job so overwhelmingly difficult to do that there’s just no possibility that you will get into serious news coverage, or investigating the stories that need to be dug out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July of this year, Miller resigned from the &lt;em&gt;Banner. &lt;/em&gt;This month he and his wife, Teresa Parker, published the first print edition of a new, weekly, print newspaper, &lt;em&gt;The Provincetown Independent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; aimed at readers, advertisers, and citizens in the towns of outer Cape Cod. This month’s paper was a preview, and regular weekly print publication will begin in early October. In the meantime, new stories are being posted &lt;a href="https://provincetownindependent.org/"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="480" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/Gliders/038d7cffd.jpg" width="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Hang gliders over the Cape Cod National Seashore (Courtesy of Edward Miller).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The territory the &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt; is covering is more diverse than the vacation-time imagery of Cape Cod might suggest. The communities in its market—Provincetown, Truro, Wellfleet, and Eastham—have median incomes &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnstable_County,_Massachusetts"&gt;at about&lt;/a&gt; the national-average level (or in the case of Provincetown, significantly below it). Some of the residents have vacation homes there; some are service-workers, small merchants and business people, or part of the working fisheries. Provincetown has long been an LGBT haven; the outer Cape has well-established arts, scientific, marine-science, and tourism-oriented institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an interesting community,” Miller told me. “There are lot of engaged people here, there is money here, this is a place that ought to be able to support a perfectly successful, profitable newspaper.” As they observed the shrinkage at the &lt;i&gt;Banner&lt;/i&gt;, which recently laid off its last local reporter, Miller and his colleagues began thinking about a new venture they might launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach they decided on—which you can read about on the &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://provincetownindependent.org/about-provincetown-independent/"&gt;own site&lt;/a&gt;, or by Allison Hagan &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/08/09/they-starting-yes-starting-newspaper-cape/i27BrH3gZnGyKiM0ontFUJ/story.html"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and  Sarah Mizes-Tan &lt;a href="https://www.capeandislands.org/post/dark-days-newspapers-see-new-light-provincetown"&gt;for the local public radio station WCAI&lt;/a&gt;—was a mix of normal for-profit business structure, and non-profit adjunct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business plan is based on a four-year hoped-for course to profitability, at which point the paper would have total paid circulation of 6,000 per week, and 19 full-time staffers. So far Miller and Parker have raised a little more than half of the business capital they are looking for. The non-profit operation has raised three times as much as its original target. This money will be used for special projects—training young journalists, supporting investigative efforts, long-term projects on “themes that are important to the community, like how young families will manage to live here,” Miller told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider" /&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="480" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/082919_Carnival_Geier4/451c32e93.jpg" width="480" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;August Carnival parade in Provincetown (Courtesy of Marcia Geier)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the ceaseless technological and business change in the news business, Miller said, “The basics of the business are that people love local newspapers. If you can provide something they want, especially information they can’t get anyplace else, they will be loyal to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weekly publication schedule of the &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt;, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/08/local-local-local-how-a-small-newspaper-survives/595900/?utm_source=feed"&gt;every-other-week schedule&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;i&gt;The Quoddy Tides &lt;/i&gt;in Maine, helps the paper resist any temptation to cover breaking national or world news, for which readers have a million faster, better sources. Instead it can cover local developments—taxes, schools, zoning, real estate, religion, business ups and downs—that simply won’t be covered anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are saying we need to come up with a new business model” for small newspapers, Miller told me. “Actually, the old business model for a local newspaper that really does its job, can actually work pretty well.” He said that he canvassed owners of similar-scale papers around the country, and found that a normal profit rate was about 8 percent of revenue. For a private-equity fund, that’s nothing. “But if you’re running a normal local business, 8 percent is pretty good.” Miller said that one local-paper owner told him,  “If I’m making more than 8 percent, I know it’s time to reinvest in the business—hire more people, give them raises, upgrade our equipment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="364" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/080919_EHay_GullPondDive_EHay_copy/757ebef28.jpg" width="466" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Cape Cod in the summertime (Courtesy of Elspeth Hay)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;em&gt;Independent’s&lt;/em&gt; advisors and business backers is &lt;a href="https://www.austinmonthly.com/AM/March-2018/The-Next-Chapter-of-Louis-Black/"&gt;Louis Black&lt;/a&gt;, who in the 1980s in Austin co-founded and edited the successful and influential alt-weekly &lt;em&gt;The Austin Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; and then was a co-founder of mega-successful SXSW. I spoke with him by phone today to ask why he’d become involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we started the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;, we didn’t know what we were doing,” he said. “It took a decade to get up to speed. Eventually we realized a paper like that &lt;em&gt;creates&lt;/em&gt; the community. It pulls it together, then sends it out.” Black said that despite the travails of print media, this was the role that he hoped papers like the&lt;em&gt; Independent&lt;/em&gt; could fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="383" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/GettyImages_925946184/11f4f8365.jpg" width="307" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Louis Black speaks during the 36th Annual Austin Music Awards (Gary Miller / Getty)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just about conveying information,” he said. “People have new ways to do that quickly. It’s about provide a cultural and intellectual center—and not only for like-minded people. It’s for people who want to engage in debate, and have principled debate. A strong local paper can do that. It’s not just about the words or information. It’s the spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black met Ed Miller and Teresa Parker because Black had a neighboring house in Cape Cod. He learned that he and Miller were both from Teaneck, New Jersey, and both had spent their careers starting publications—Black’s with more financial success. Eventually Black decided to put time and money into the new &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt; venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did he think that it realistically had a chance? Black laughed, chuckled out some version of “Who knows?” and then said: “Because Cape Cod is what it is, and because Ed is who he is, I think they have a shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Miller, and like me, Black is from the dreaded and aging Baby Boom generation. “We’re too old to do this,” Black told Miller, as they considered the years-long, dicey effort of starting a new publication. “But the young people don’t know how, and we have to show them. People need to see that it can be done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to hang the sword up,” Black told me. “But we can’t. We’re living in a world where if we believe, we have to engage.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WE'RE ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS ABOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT KEEP YOU UP AT NIGHT. IF YOU HAVE ONE, &lt;a class="external" href="http://laist.com/2018/06/19/hey_la_ask_us_anything.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASK IT HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Take a look at our homepage any day, and you're likely to come across a story about homelessness — from efforts to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="http://www.laist.com/2018/10/31/la_adu_program.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;house people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="http://www.laist.com/2018/11/27/la_county_homeless_shelter_health_standards.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;health standards for homeless shelters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to the rise of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="http://www.laist.com/2018/10/31/skid_row_homeless_children.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;children who are homeless&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But those stories are written for adults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And one of those adults, &lt;span&gt;KPCC listener Victoria Simon, had a question about how to approach the topic with children in a way that includes empathy and compassion, but also keeps safety in mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I am the parent of a six-year-old and a three-year-old and we live in Santa Monica where we come face to face with homelessness every day," she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"So, how do I thread that needle in terms of educating them and also keeping them safe?" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EMPATHY IS KEY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the most important things to keep in mind when talking to children about homelessness is coming from a place of empathy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"When you tell a child that anyone can be homeless you then can also open up a discussion about the many circumstances that go into homelessness," said author and homeless advocate Angela Sanchez. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She wrote and illustrated the children's book &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.facebook.com/ScruffyandtheEgg/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scruffy and the Egg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which was inspired by stories Sanchez and her father used to tell each other in her teen years when they were experiencing homelessness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Simon and Sanchez met up in studio for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2018/11/27/19163/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;KPCC's Take Two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; — to have a candid conversation about how to explain homelessness to children. Here's a rundown of some of Sanchez's advice based on her own experience with being homeless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANYONE CAN BE HOMELESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We see homelessness and poverty as tied to ideas of merit and so when you tell a child that anyone can be homeless, you also open up the discussion about the many circumstances that go into homelessness," said Sanchez.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though the most visible type of person experiencing homelessness are the individuals we see out in the streets, Sanchez went on to explain families comprise &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="http://familiesbychoice.org/homeless-facts.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;40 percent of the total homeless population&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2015-AHAR-Part-1.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;25 percent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of all people experiencing homelessness are under the age of 18.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The average age is eight years old," Sanchez said. "When I talk to kids about that, I usually say that means a third grader is the most likely type of child you will see who is homeless."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="http://www.laist.com/2018/06/19/la_explained_homelessness.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;LA Explained: Homelessness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAKE THINGS AS CONCRETE AS POSSIBLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sanchez has found that when she speaks to kids about homelessness and reveals that the most common age is close to or exactly their own, something clicks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It makes an otherwise abstract concept far more tangible, understandable and relatable. The reaction is one full of empathy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Usually the response that I've gotten is 'Oh, how do I help?' or 'I've never seen another homeless kid' or 'How do I know when someone is homeless.'" Sanchez said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's at this point in the conversation, she suggests, you list out different ways they, as children, can make an impact. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHOW THEM THEY CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a lot of ways people can our city's homeless population. But children often see the world differently and have an endless supply of compassion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Simon brought up how her six-year-old son suggested housing a homeless person in their home as a way of helping out. She found herself at a loss of how to respond. Sanchez proposed focusing on impact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"You can always turn around and say: Think about all the help that you need in one day and I live with you. And so being able to list those things and say, this is someone else who will also need that kind of stuff too."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you can break down the basic building blocks of a situation that makes it more consumable. Here are some more concrete ways you can suggest to help:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Volunteer at a family soup kitchen - For young kids, it's best to have them interacting with families and other children they could possibly relate to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lend an ear - Volunteer once a month to sit and speak with someone and give them your full attention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.schoolonwheels.org/volunteer/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;School On Wheels, Inc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. - They work with K-12 kids who are experiencing homelessness and their whole focus is to provide volunteer tutors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEEPING SAFETY IN MIND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the main concerns that kept popping up during Simon and Sanchez's conversation was that of safety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Sometimes when you're with your kids, you don't know whether it's appropriate to step in," Simon said. "You don't know how that person's day is going or whether it's an appropriate thing to do."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To that point, Sanchez brought up the vulnerability of the homeless population. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"By and large, it's quite the opposite," she said. "People who are homeless are generally the most vulnerable to assault. Sexual, physical or otherwise."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, when it comes to individual safety being a concern, especially when it comes to checking for lucidity, Sanchez said "you can always say, 'it's okay to ask people how they're doing today.'"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And when kids get a little older, she advises "helping them decide when they would like to intervene and what kind of judgment they should be using."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey, thanks. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You read the entire story.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every concurrency API needs a way to run code concurrently. Here's
some examples of what that looks like using different APIs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;go myfunc();                                // Golang

pthread_create(&amp;amp;thread_id, NULL, &amp;amp;myfunc);  /* C with POSIX threads */

spawn(modulename, myfuncname, [])           % Erlang

threading.Thread(target=myfunc).start()     # Python with threads

asyncio.create_task(myfunc())               # Python with asyncio
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of variations in the notation and terminology, but the
semantics are the same: these all arrange for &lt;tt&gt;myfunc&lt;/tt&gt; to start
running concurrently to the rest of the program, and then return
immediately so that the parent can do other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another option is to use callbacks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;QObject::connect(&amp;amp;emitter, SIGNAL(event()),        // C++ with Qt
                 &amp;amp;receiver, SLOT(myfunc()))

g_signal_connect(emitter, "event", myfunc, NULL)   /* C with GObject */

document.getElementById("myid").onclick = myfunc;  // Javascript

promise.then(myfunc, errorhandler)                 // Javascript with Promises

deferred.addCallback(myfunc)                       # Python with Twisted

future.add_done_callback(myfunc)                   # Python with asyncio
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the notation varies, but these all accomplish the same thing:
they arrange that from now on, if and when a certain event occurs,
then &lt;tt&gt;myfunc&lt;/tt&gt; will run. Then once they've set that up, they
immediately return so the caller can do other things. (Sometimes
callbacks get dressed up with fancy helpers like &lt;a class="external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all" rel="nofollow"&gt;promise&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race" rel="nofollow"&gt;combinators&lt;/a&gt;,
or &lt;a class="external" href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/servers.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Twisted-style protocols/transports&lt;/a&gt;,
but the core idea is the same.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And... that's it. Take any real-world, general-purpose concurrency
API, and you'll probably find that it falls into one or the other of
those buckets (or sometimes both, like asyncio).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But my new library &lt;a class="external" href="https://trio.readthedocs.io" rel="nofollow"&gt;Trio&lt;/a&gt; is weird. It
doesn't use either approach. Instead, if we want to run &lt;tt&gt;myfunc&lt;/tt&gt; and
&lt;tt&gt;anotherfunc&lt;/tt&gt; concurrently, we write something like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;trio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;open_nursery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;nursery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;nursery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;start_soon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;myfunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;nursery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;start_soon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;anotherfunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people first encounter this "nursery" construct, they tend to
find it confusing. Why is there an indented block? What's this
&lt;tt&gt;nursery&lt;/tt&gt; object, and why do I need one before I can spawn a task?
Then they realize that it prevents them from using patterns they've
gotten used to in other frameworks, and they get really annoyed. It
feels quirky and idiosyncratic and too high-level to be a basic
primitive. These are understandable reactions! But bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this post, I want to convince you that nurseries aren't quirky or
idiosyncratic at all, but rather a new control flow primitive that's
just as fundamental as for loops or function calls. And furthermore,
the other approaches we saw above – thread spawning and callback
registration – should be removed entirely and replaced with
nurseries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sound unlikely? Something similar has actually happened before: the
&lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; statement was once the king of control flow. Now it's a
&lt;a class="external" href="https://xkcd.com/292/" rel="nofollow"&gt;punchline&lt;/a&gt;. A few languages still have
something they call &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, but it's different and far weaker than
the original &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;. And most languages don't even have that. What
happened? This was so long ago that most people aren't familiar with
the story anymore, but it turns out to be surprisingly relevant. So
we'll start by reminding ourselves what a &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; was, exactly, and
then see what it can teach us about concurrency APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's review some history: Early computers were programmed using
&lt;a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language" rel="nofollow"&gt;assembly language&lt;/a&gt;, or other even
more primitive mechanisms. This kinda sucked. So in the 1950s, people
like &lt;a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Backus" rel="nofollow"&gt;John Backus&lt;/a&gt; at
IBM and &lt;a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper" rel="nofollow"&gt;Grace Hopper&lt;/a&gt;
at Remington Rand started to develop languages like &lt;a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran" rel="nofollow"&gt;FORTRAN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC" rel="nofollow"&gt;FLOW-MATIC&lt;/a&gt; (better known for its
direct successor &lt;a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL" rel="nofollow"&gt;COBOL&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLOW-MATIC was very ambitious for its time. You can think of it as
Python's great-great-great-...-grandparent: the first language that
was designed for humans first, and computers second. Here's some
FLOW-MATIC code to give you a taste of what it looked like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that unlike modern languages, there's no &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; blocks,
loop blocks, or function calls here – in fact there's no block
delimiters or indentation at all. It's just a flat list of statements.
That's not because this program happens to be too short to use fancier
control syntax – it's because block syntax wasn't invented yet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, FLOW-MATIC had two options for flow control. Normally, it was
sequential, just like you'd expect: start at the top and move
downwards, one statement at a time. But if you execute a special
statement like &lt;tt&gt;JUMP TO&lt;/tt&gt;, then it could directly transfer control
somewhere else. For example, statement (13) jumps back to statement
(2):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like for our concurrency primitives at the beginning, there was
some disagreement about what to call this "do a one-way jump"
operation. Here it's &lt;tt&gt;JUMP TO&lt;/tt&gt;, but the name that stuck was &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;
(like "go to", get it?), so that's what I'll use here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the complete set of &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; jumps in this little program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think this looks confusing, you're not alone! This style of
jump-based programming is something that FLOW-MATIC inherited pretty
much directly from assembly language. It's powerful, and a good fit to
how computer hardware actually works, but it's super confusing to work
with directly. That tangle of arrows is why the term "spaghetti code"
was invented. Clearly, we needed something better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But... what is it about &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; that causes all these problems? Why
are some control structures OK, and some not? How do we pick the good
ones? At the time, this was really unclear, and it's hard to fix a
problem if you don't understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let's hit pause on the history for a moment – everyone knows
&lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; was bad. What does this have to do with concurrency? Well,
consider Golang's famous &lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; statement, used to spawn a new
"goroutine" (lightweight thread):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we draw a diagram of its control flow? Well, it's a little
different from either of the ones we saw above, because control
actually splits. We might draw it like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the colors are intended to indicate that &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; paths are taken.
From the perspective of the parent goroutine (green line), control
flows sequentially: it comes in the top, and then immediately comes
out the bottom. Meanwhile, from the perspective of the child (lavender
line), control comes in the top, and then jumps over to the body of
&lt;tt&gt;myfunc&lt;/tt&gt;. Unlike a regular function call, this jump is one-way: when
running &lt;tt&gt;myfunc&lt;/tt&gt; we switch to a whole new stack, and the runtime
immediately forgets where we came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this doesn't just apply to Golang. This is the flow control
diagram for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the primitives we listed at the beginning of this
post:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threading libraries usually provide some sort of handle object that
lets you &lt;tt&gt;join&lt;/tt&gt; the thread later – but this is an independent
operation that the language doesn't know anything about. The actual
thread spawning primitive has the control flow shown above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registering a callback is semantically equivalent to starting a
background thread that (a) blocks until some event occurs, and
then (b) runs the callback. (Though obviously the implementation is
different.) So in terms of high-level control flow, registering a
callback is essentially a &lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Futures and promises are the same too: when you call a function and
it returns a promise, that means it's scheduled the work to happen
in the background, and then given you a handle object to join the
work later (if you want). In terms of control flow semantics, this
is just like spawning a thread. Then you register callbacks on the
promise, so see the previous bullet point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This same exact pattern shows up in many, many forms: the key
similarity is that in all these cases, control flow splits, with one
side doing a one-way jump and the other side returning to the caller.
Once you know what to look for, you'll start seeing it all over the
place – it's a fun game! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annoyingly, though, there is no standard name for this category of
control flow constructs. So just like "&lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; statement" became the
umbrella term for all the different &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;-like constructs, I'm
going to use "&lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; statement" as a umbrella term for these. Why
&lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt;? One reason is that Golang gives us a particularly pure example
of the form. And the other is... well, you've probably guessed where
I'm going with all this. Look at these two diagrams. Notice any
similarities?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's right: &lt;strong&gt;go statements are a form of goto statement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concurrent programs are notoriously difficult to write and reason
about. So are &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;-based programs. Is it possible that this might
be for some of the same reasons? In modern languages, the problems
caused by &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; are largely solved. If we study how they fixed
&lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, will it teach us how to make more usable concurrency APIs?
Let's find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is it about &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; that makes it cause so many problems? In
the late 1960s, &lt;a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra" rel="nofollow"&gt;Edsger W. Dijkstra&lt;/a&gt; wrote a pair of
now-famous papers that helped make this much clearer: &lt;a class="external" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15335993203437612903&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0,5" rel="nofollow"&gt;Go to statement
considered harmful&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/ewd02xx/EWD249.PDF" rel="nofollow"&gt;Notes on structured programming&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/#id12" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;: the destroyer of abstraction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these papers, Dijkstra was worried about the problem of how you
write non-trivial software and get it correct. I can't give them due
justice here; there's all kinds of fascinating insights. For example,
you may have heard this quote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="Testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!" src="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/testing.png"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep, that's from &lt;em&gt;Notes on structured programming&lt;/em&gt;. But his major
concern was &lt;em&gt;abstraction&lt;/em&gt;. He wanted to write programs that are too
big to hold in your head all at once. To do this, you need to treat
parts of the program like a black box – like when you see a Python
program do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;then you don't need to know all the details of how &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; is
implemented (string formatting, buffering, cross-platform differences,
...). You just need to know that it will somehow print the text you
give it, and then you can spend your energy thinking about whether
that's what you want to have happen at this point in your code.
Dijkstra wanted languages to support this kind of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this point, block syntax had been invented, and languages like
ALGOL had accumulated ~5 distinct types of control structure: they
still had sequential flow and &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And had also acquired variants on if/else, loops, and function calls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can implement these higher-level constructs using &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, and
early on, that's how people thought of them: as a convenient
shorthand. But what Dijkstra pointed out is that if you look at these
diagrams, there's a big difference between &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; and the rest. For
everything except &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, flow control comes in the top → [stuff
happens] → flow control comes out the bottom. We might call this the
"black box rule": if a control structure has this shape, then in
contexts where you don't care about the details of what happens
internally, you can ignore the [stuff happens] part, and treat the
whole thing as regular sequential flow. And even better, this is also
true of any code that's &lt;em&gt;composed&lt;/em&gt; out of those pieces. When I look at
this code:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't have to go read the definition of &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; and all its
transitive dependencies just to figure out how the control flow works.
Maybe inside &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; there's a loop, and inside the loop there's an
if/else, and inside the if/else there's another function call... or
maybe it's something else. It doesn't really matter: I know control
will flow into &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt;, the function will do its thing, and then
eventually control will come back to the code I'm reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem like this is obvious, but if you have a language with
&lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; – a language where functions and everything else are built on
top of &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; can jump anywhere, at any time – then
these control structures aren't black boxes at all! If you have a
function, and inside the function there's a loop, and inside the loop
there's an if/else, and inside the if/else there's a &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;... then
that &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; could send the control anywhere it wants. Maybe control
will suddenly return from another function entirely, one you haven't
even called yet. You don't know!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this breaks abstraction: it means that &lt;em&gt;every function call is
potentially a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;em&gt;statement in disguise, and the only way to
know is to keep the entire source code of your system in your head at
once.&lt;/em&gt; As soon as &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; is in your language, you stop being able do
local reasoning about flow control. That's &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; leads to
spaghetti code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now that Dijkstra understood the problem, he was able to solve it.
Here's his revolutionary proposal: we should stop thinking of
if/loops/function calls as shorthands for &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, but rather as
fundamental primitives in their own rights – and we should remove
&lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; entirely from our languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here in 2018, this seems obvious enough. But have you seen how
programmers react when you try to take away their toys because they're
not smart enough to use them safely? Yeah, some things never change.
In 1969, this proposal was &lt;em&gt;incredibly controversial&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth" rel="nofollow"&gt;Donald Knuth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="external" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17147143327681396418&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0,5" rel="nofollow"&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;. People who had become experts on writing code with &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;
quite reasonably resented having to basically learn how to program
again in order to express their ideas using the newer, more
constraining constructs. And of course it required building a whole
new set of languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="On the left, a photo of a snarling wolf. On the right, a photo of a grumpy bulldog." src="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/wolf-and-bulldog.jpg"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left: A traditional &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;. Right: A domesticated &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, as
seen in C, C#, Golang, etc. The inability to cross function
boundaries means it can still pee on your shoes, but it probably
won't rip your face off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, modern languages are a bit less strict about this than
Dijkstra's original formulation. They'll let you break out of multiple
nested structures at once using constructs like &lt;tt&gt;break&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt&gt;continue&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt;. But fundamentally, they're all designed
around Dijkstra's idea; even these constructs that push the boundaries
do so only in strictly limited ways. In particular, functions – which
are the fundamental tool for wrapping up control flow inside a black
box – are considered inviolate. You can't &lt;tt&gt;break&lt;/tt&gt; out of one
function and into another, and a &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; can take you out of the
current function, but no further. Whatever control flow shenanigans a
function gets up to internally, other functions don't have to care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This even extends to &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; itself. You'll find a few languages that
still have something they call &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, like C, C#, Golang, ... but
they've added heavy restrictions. At the very least, they won't let
you jump out of one function body and into another. Unless you're
working in assembly , the classic, unrestricted &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; is gone.
Dijkstra won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/#id13" rel="nofollow"&gt;A surprise benefit: removing &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; statements enables new features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;And once &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; disappeared, something interesting happened:
language designers were able to start adding features that depend on
control flow being structured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Python has some nice syntax for resource cleanup: the
&lt;tt&gt;with&lt;/tt&gt; statement. You can write things like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;# Python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"my-file"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;file_handle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;and it guarantees that the file will be open during the &lt;tt&gt;...&lt;/tt&gt; code,
but then closed immediately afterward. Most modern languages have some
equivalent (RAII, &lt;tt&gt;using&lt;/tt&gt;, try-with-resource, &lt;tt&gt;defer&lt;/tt&gt;, ...). And
they all assume that control flows in an orderly, structured way. If
we used &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; to jump into the middle of our &lt;tt&gt;with&lt;/tt&gt; block... what
would that even do? Is the file open or not? What if we jumped out
again, instead of exiting normally? Would the file get closed? This
feature just doesn't work in any coherent way if your language has
&lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Error handling has a similar problem: when something goes wrong, what
should your code do? Often the answer is to pass the buck up the stack
to your code's caller, let them figure out how to deal with it. Modern
languages have constructs specifically to make this easier, like
exceptions, or other forms of &lt;a class="external" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/index.html#the-question-mark-operator-" rel="nofollow"&gt;automatic error propagation&lt;/a&gt;.
But your language can only provide this help if it &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; a stack, and
a reliable concept of "caller". Look again at the control-flow
spaghetti in our FLOW-MATIC program and imagine that in the middle of
that it tried to raise an exception. Where would it even go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/#id14" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; statements: not even once&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; – the traditional kind that ignores function boundaries –
isn't just the regular kind of bad feature, the kind that's hard to
use correctly. If it were, it might have survived – lots of bad
features have. But it's much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't use &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; yourself, merely having it as an option
in your language makes &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; harder to use. Whenever you start
using a third-party library, you can't treat it as a black box – you
have to go read through it all to find out which functions are regular
functions, and which ones are idiosyncratic flow control constructs in
disguise. This is a serious obstacle to local reasoning. And you lose
powerful language features like reliable resource cleanup and
automatic error propagation. Better to remove &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; entirely, in
favor of control flow constructs that follow the "black box" rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that's the history of &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;. Now, how much of this applies to
&lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; statements? Well... basically, all of it! The analogy turns out
to be shockingly exact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go statements break abstraction.&lt;/strong&gt; Remember how we said that if our
language allows &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, then any function might be a &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; in
disguise? In most concurrency frameworks, &lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; statements cause the
exact same problem: whenever you call a function, it might or might
not spawn some background task. The function seemed to return, but is
it still running in the background? There's no way to know without
reading all its source code, transitively. When will it finish? Hard
to say. If you have &lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; statements, then functions are no longer
black boxes with respect to control flow. In my &lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/" rel="nofollow"&gt;first post on
concurrency APIs&lt;/a&gt;,
I called this "violating causality", and found that it was the root
cause of many common, real-world issues in programs using asyncio and
Twisted, like problems with backpressure, problems with shutting down
properly, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go statements break automatic resource cleanup.&lt;/strong&gt; Let's look again
at that &lt;tt&gt;with&lt;/tt&gt; statement example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;# Python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"my-file"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;file_handle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before, we said that we were "guaranteed" that the file will be open
while the &lt;tt&gt;...&lt;/tt&gt; code is running, and then closed afterwards. But
what if the &lt;tt&gt;...&lt;/tt&gt; code spawns a background task? Then our guarantee
is lost: the operations that &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like they're inside the &lt;tt&gt;with&lt;/tt&gt;
block might actually keep running &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;tt&gt;with&lt;/tt&gt; block ends, and
then crash because the file gets closed while they're still using it.
And again, you can't tell from local inspection; to know if this is
happening you have to go read the source code to all the functions
called inside the &lt;tt&gt;...&lt;/tt&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want this code to work properly, we need to somehow keep track
of any background tasks, and manually arrange for the file to be
closed only when they're finished. It's doable – unless we're using
some library that doesn't provide any way to get notified when the
task is finished, which is distressingly common (e.g. because it
doesn't expose any task handle that you can join on). But even in the
best case, the unstructured control flow means the language can't help
us. We're back to implementing resource cleanup by hand, like in the
bad old days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go statements break error handling.&lt;/strong&gt; Like we discussed above,
modern languages provide powerful tools like exceptions to help us
make sure that errors are detected and propagated to the right place.
But these tools depend on having a reliable concept of "the current
code's caller". As soon as you spawn a task or register a callback,
that concept is broken. As a result, every mainstream concurrency
framework I know of simply gives up. If an error occurs in a
background task, and you don't handle it manually, then the runtime
just... drops it on the floor and crosses its fingers that it wasn't
too important. If you're lucky it might print something on the
console. (The only other software I've used that thinks "print
something and keep going" is a good error handling strategy is grotty
old Fortran libraries, but here we are.) Even Rust – the language
voted Most Obsessed With Threading Correctness by its high school
class – is guilty of this. If a background thread panics, Rust
&lt;a class="external" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/" rel="nofollow"&gt;discards the error and hopes for the best&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; handle errors properly in these systems, by
carefully making sure to join every thread, or by building your own
error propagation mechanism like &lt;a class="external" href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/defer.html#visual-explanation" rel="nofollow"&gt;errbacks in Twisted&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a class="external" href="https://hackernoon.com/promises-and-error-handling-4a11af37cb0e" rel="nofollow"&gt;Promise.catch in Javascript&lt;/a&gt;.
But now you're writing an ad-hoc, fragile reimplementation of the
features your language already has. You've lost useful stuff like
"tracebacks" and "debuggers". All it takes is forgetting to call
&lt;tt&gt;Promise.catch&lt;/tt&gt; once and suddenly you're dropping serious errors on
the floor without even realizing. And even if you do somehow solve all
these problems, you'll still end up with two redundant systems for
doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/#id16" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; statements: not even once&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; was the obvious primitive for the first practical
high-level languages, &lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; was the obvious primitive for the first
practical concurrency frameworks: it matches how the underlying
schedulers actually work, and it's powerful enough to implement any
other concurrent flow pattern. But again like &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, it breaks
control flow abstractions, so that merely having it as an option in
your language makes everything harder to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news, though, is that these problems can all be solved:
Dijkstra showed us how! We need to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a replacement for &lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; statements that has similar power, but
follows the "black box rule",&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build that new construct into our concurrency framework as a
primitive, and don't include any form of &lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's what Trio did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the core idea: every time our control splits into multiple
concurrent paths, we want to make sure that they join up again. So for
example, if we want to do three things at the same time, our control
flow should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that this has just one arrow going in the top and one coming
out the bottom, so it follows Dijkstra's black box rule. Now, how can
we turn this sketch into a concrete language construct? There are some
existing constructs that meet this constraint, but (a) my proposal is
slightly different than all the ones I'm aware of and has advantages
over them (especially in the context of wanting to make this a
standalone primitive), and (b) the concurrency literature is vast and
complicated, and trying to pick apart all the history and tradeoffs
would totally derail the argument, so I'm going to defer that to a
separate post. Here, I'll just focus on explaining my solution. But
please be aware that I'm not claiming to have like, invented the idea
of concurrency or something, this draws inspiration from many sources,
I'm standing on the shoulders of giants, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's how we're going to do it: first, we declare that a
parent task cannot start any child tasks unless it first creates a
place for the children to live: a &lt;em&gt;nursery&lt;/em&gt;. It does this by opening a
&lt;em&gt;nursery block&lt;/em&gt;; in Trio, we do this using Python's &lt;tt&gt;async with&lt;/tt&gt;
syntax:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening a nursery block automatically creates an object representing
this nursery, and the &lt;tt&gt;as nursery&lt;/tt&gt; syntax assigns this object to the
variable named &lt;tt&gt;nursery&lt;/tt&gt;. Then we can use the nursery object's
&lt;tt&gt;start_soon&lt;/tt&gt; method to start concurrent tasks: in this case, one
task calling the function &lt;tt&gt;myfunc&lt;/tt&gt;, and another calling the function
&lt;tt&gt;anotherfunc&lt;/tt&gt;. Conceptually, these tasks execute &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the
nursery block. In fact, it's often convenient to think of the code
written inside the nursery block as being an initial task that's
automatically started when the block is created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the nursery block doesn't exit until all the tasks inside
it have exited – if the parent task reaches the end of the block
before all the children are finished, then it pauses there and waits
for them. The nursery automatically expands to hold the children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the control flow: you can see how it matches the basic pattern
we showed at the beginning of this section:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This design has a number of consequences, not all of which are
obvious. Let's think through some of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/#id18" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nurseries preserve the function abstraction.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental problem with &lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; statements is that when you call a
function, you don't know whether it's going to spawn some background
task that keeps running after it's finished. With nurseries, you don't
have to worry about this: any function can open a nursery and run
multiple concurrent tasks, but the function can't return until they've
all finished. So when a function does return, you know it's really
done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/#id19" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nurseries support dynamic task spawning.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a simpler primitive that would also satisfy our flow control
diagram above. It takes a list of thunks, and runs them all
concurrently:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;run_concurrently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;myfunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;anotherfunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the problem with this is that you have to know up front the
complete list of tasks you're going to run, which isn't always true.
For example, server programs generally have &lt;tt&gt;accept&lt;/tt&gt; loops, that
take incoming connections and start a new task to handle each of them.
Here's a minimal &lt;tt&gt;accept&lt;/tt&gt; loop in Trio:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;trio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;open_nursery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;nursery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;incoming_connection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;server_socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;nursery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;start_soon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;connection_handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;incoming_connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With nurseries, this is trivial, but implementing it using
&lt;tt&gt;run_concurrently&lt;/tt&gt; would be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more awkward. And if you wanted
to, it would be easy to implement &lt;tt&gt;run_concurrently&lt;/tt&gt; on top of
nurseries – but it's not really necessary, since in the simple cases
&lt;tt&gt;run_concurrently&lt;/tt&gt; can handle, the nursery notation is just as
readable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/#id20" rel="nofollow"&gt;There is an escape.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nursery object also gives us an escape hatch. What if you really
do need to write a function that spawns a background task, where the
background task outlives the function itself? Easy: pass the function
a nursery object. There's no rule that only the code directly inside
the &lt;tt&gt;async with open_nursery()&lt;/tt&gt; block can call
&lt;tt&gt;nursery.start_soon&lt;/tt&gt; – so long as the nursery block remains open
, then anyone who acquires a reference to the nursery object gets
the capability of spawning tasks into that nursery. You can pass it in
as a function argument, send it through a queue, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means that you can write functions that "break the
rules", but within limits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since nursery objects have to be passed around explicitly, you can
immediately identify which functions violate normal flow control by
looking at their call sites, so local reasoning is still possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any tasks the function spawns are still bound by the lifetime of the
nursery that was passed in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the calling code can only pass in nursery objects that it itself
has access to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is still very different from the traditional model where any
code can at any moment spawn a background task with unbounded
lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One place this is useful is in the proof that nurseries have
equivalent expressive power to &lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; statements, but this post is
already long enough so I'll leave that for another day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/#id21" rel="nofollow"&gt;You can define new types that quack like a nursery.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard nursery semantics provide a solid foundation, but
sometimes you want something different. Perhaps you're envious of
Erlang and its supervisors, and want to define a nursery-like class
that handles exceptions by restarting the child task. That's totally
possible, and to your users, it'll look just like a regular nursery:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;my_supervisor_library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;open_supervisor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;nursery_alike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;nursery_alike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;start_soon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a function that takes a nursery as an argument, then you
can pass it one of these instead to control the error-handling policy
for the tasks it spawns. Pretty nifty. But there is one subtlety here
that pushes Trio towards different conventions than asyncio or some
other libraries: it means that &lt;tt&gt;start_soon&lt;/tt&gt; has to take a function,
not a coroutine object or a &lt;tt&gt;Future&lt;/tt&gt;. (You can call a function
multiple times, but there's no way to restart a coroutine object or a
&lt;tt&gt;Future&lt;/tt&gt;.) I think this is the better convention anyway for a number
of reasons (especially since Trio doesn't even have &lt;tt&gt;Future&lt;/tt&gt;s!),
but still, worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/#id22" rel="nofollow"&gt;No, really, nurseries &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; wait for the tasks inside to exit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also worth talking about how task cancellation and task joining
interact, since there are some subtleties here that could – if handled
incorrectly – break the nursery invariants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Trio, it's possible for code to receive a cancellation request at
any time. After a cancellation is requested, then the next time the
code executes a "checkpoint" operation (&lt;a class="external" href="https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference-core.html#checkpoints" rel="nofollow"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt;),
a &lt;tt&gt;Cancelled&lt;/tt&gt; exception is raised. This means that there's a gap
between when a cancellation is &lt;em&gt;requested&lt;/em&gt; and when it actually
&lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt; – it might be a while before the task executes a checkpoint,
and then after that the exception has to unwind the stack, run cleanup
handlers, etc. When this happens, the nursery always waits for the
full cleanup to happen. We &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; terminate a task without giving it
a chance to run cleanup handlers, and we &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; leave a task to run
unsupervised outside of the nursery, even if it's in the process of
being cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/#id23" rel="nofollow"&gt;Automatic resource cleanup works.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because nurseries follow the black box rule, they make &lt;tt&gt;with&lt;/tt&gt; blocks
work again. There's no chance that, say, closing a file at the end of
a &lt;tt&gt;with&lt;/tt&gt; block will accidentally break a background task that's
still using that file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/#id24" rel="nofollow"&gt;Automated error propagation works.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted above, in most concurrency systems, unhandled errors in
background tasks are simply discarded. There's literally nothing else
to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Trio, since every task lives inside a nursery, and every nursery is
part of a parent task, and parent tasks are required to wait for the
tasks inside the nursery... we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have something we can do with
unhandled errors. If a background task terminates with an exception,
we can rethrow it in the parent task. The intuition here is that a
nursery is something like a "concurrent call" primitive: we can think
of our example above as calling &lt;tt&gt;myfunc&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;anotherfunc&lt;/tt&gt; at the
same time, so our call stack has become a tree. And exceptions
propagate up this call tree towards the root, just like they propagate
up a regular call stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one subtlety here though: when we re-raise an exception in
the parent task, it will start propagating in the parent task.
Generally, that means that the parent task will exit the nursery
block. But we've already said that the parent task cannot leave the
nursery block while there are still child tasks running. So what do we
do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is that when an unhandled exception occurs in a child, Trio
immediately cancels all the other tasks in the same nursery, and then
waits for them to finish before re-raising the exception. The
intuition here is that exceptions cause the stack to unwind, and if we
want to unwind past a branch point in our stack tree, we need to
unwind the other branches, by cancelling them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does mean though that if you want to implement nurseries in your
language, you may need some kind of integration between the nursery
code and your cancellation system. This might be tricky if you're
using a language like C# or Golang where cancellation is usually
managed through manual object passing and convention, or (even worse)
one that doesn't have a generic cancellation mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/#id25" rel="nofollow"&gt;A surprise benefit: removing &lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; statements enables new features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminating &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; allowed previous language designers to make
stronger assumptions about the structure of programs, which enabled
new features like &lt;tt&gt;with&lt;/tt&gt; blocks and exceptions; eliminating &lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt;
statements has a similar effect. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trio's cancellation system is easier to use and more reliable than
competitors, because it can assume that tasks are nested in a
regular tree structure; see &lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/timeouts-and-cancellation-for-humans/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Timeouts and cancellation for humans&lt;/a&gt;
for a full discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trio is the only Python concurrency library where control-C works
the way Python developers expect (&lt;a class="external" href="https://vorpus.org/blog/control-c-handling-in-python-and-trio/" rel="nofollow"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt;).
This would be impossible without nurseries providing a reliable
mechanism for propagating exceptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that's the theory. How's it work in practice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well... that's an empirical question: you should try it and find out!
But seriously, we just won't know for sure until lots of people have
pounded on it. At this point I'm pretty confident that the foundation
is sound, but maybe we'll realize we need to make some tweaks, like
how the early structured programming advocates eventually backed off
from eliminating &lt;tt&gt;break&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;continue&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you're an experienced concurrent programmer who's just learning
Trio, then you should expect to find it a bit rocky at times. You'll
have to &lt;a class="external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48282841/in-trio-how-can-i-have-a-background-task-that-lives-as-long-as-my-object-does" rel="nofollow"&gt;learn new ways to do things&lt;/a&gt;
– just like programmers in the 1970s found it challenging to learn how
to write code without &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But of course, that's the point. As Knuth wrote (&lt;a class="external" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17147143327681396418&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0,5" rel="nofollow"&gt;Knuth,
1974&lt;/a&gt;,
p. 275):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Probably the worst mistake any one can make with respect to the
subject of &lt;strong&gt;go to&lt;/strong&gt; statements is to assume that "structured
programming" is achieved by writing programs as we always have and
then eliminating the &lt;strong&gt;go to&lt;/strong&gt;'s. Most &lt;strong&gt;go to&lt;/strong&gt;'s shouldn't be
there in the first place! What we really want is to conceive of our
program in such a way that we rarely even &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;strong&gt;go to&lt;/strong&gt;
statements, because the real need for them hardly ever arises. The
language in which we express our ideas has a strong influence on
our thought processes. Therefore, Dijkstra asks for more new
language features – structures which encourage clear thinking – in
order to avoid the &lt;strong&gt;go to&lt;/strong&gt;'s temptations towards complications.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so far, that's been my experience with using nurseries: they
encourage clear thinking. They lead to designs that are more robust,
easier to use, and just better all around. And the limitations
actually make it easier to solve problems, because you spend less time
being tempted towards unnecessary complications. Using Trio has, in a
very real sense, taught me to be a better programmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, consider the Happy Eyeballs algorithm (&lt;a class="external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8305" rel="nofollow"&gt;RFC 8305&lt;/a&gt;), which is a simple
concurrent algorithm for speeding up the establishment of TCP
connections. Conceptually, the algorithm isn't complicated – you race
several connection attempts against each other, with a staggered start
to avoid overloading the network. But if you look at &lt;a class="external" href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/compare/trunk...glyph:statemachine-hostnameendpoint" rel="nofollow"&gt;Twisted's best
implementation&lt;/a&gt;,
it's almost 600 lines of Python, and still has &lt;a class="external" href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9345" rel="nofollow"&gt;at least one logic
bug&lt;/a&gt;. The equivalent in
Trio is more than &lt;strong&gt;15x&lt;/strong&gt; shorter. More importantly, using Trio I was
able to write it in minutes instead of months, and I got the logic
correct on my first try. I never could have done this in any other
framework, even ones where I have much more experience. For more
details, you can &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-R704I8ySE" rel="nofollow"&gt;watch my talk at Pyninsula last month&lt;/a&gt;. Is this typical?
Time will tell. But it's certainly promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popular concurrency primitives – &lt;tt&gt;go&lt;/tt&gt; statements, thread
spawning functions, callbacks, futures, promises, ... they're all
variants on &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, in theory and in practice. And not even the
modern domesticated &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, but the old-testament fire-and-brimstone
&lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, that could leap across function boundaries. These primitives
are dangerous even if we don't use them directly, because they
undermine our ability to reason about control flow and compose complex
systems out of abstract modular parts, and they interfere with useful
language features like automatic resource cleanup and error
propagation. Therefore, like &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;, they have no place in a modern
high-level language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nurseries provide a safe and convenient alternative that preserves the
full power of your language, enables powerful new features (as
demonstrated by Trio's cancellation scopes and control-C handling),
and can produce dramatic improvements in readability, productivity,
and correctness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, to fully capture these benefits, we do need to remove
the old primitives entirely, and this probably requires building new
concurrency frameworks from scratch – just like eliminating &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt;
required designing new languages. But as impressive as FLOW-MATIC was
for its time, most of us are glad that we've upgraded to something
better. I don't think we'll regret switching to nurseries either, and
Trio demonstrates that this is a viable design for practical,
general-purpose concurrency frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Day Care Directors Are Playing Doctor, and Parents Suffer</title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/upshot/day-care-pink-eye-parents.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rss" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2019-09-16T17:25:11Z</updated><id>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/upshot/day-care-pink-eye-parents.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rss</id><summary type="html">&lt;table style="border: 1px solid #E0E0E0; margin: 0; padding: 0; background-color: #F0F0F0" valign="top" align="left" cellpadding="0" width="100%"&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a lot of pink eye is caused by viruses, which are unaffected by antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when pink eye is caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotics have a limited effect. They &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001211.pub3/full" rel="nofollow"&gt;slightly increase the chance&lt;/a&gt; that a child will feel better within two to five days. But there’s no promise of a cure the “next day,” as most day care centers seem to believe,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and no lessening of infectiousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Read more about children and health at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://parenting.nytimes.com/health?module=nav-bar&amp;amp;action=click" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NYT Parenting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not just an American problem. A &lt;a class="external" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/348696" rel="nofollow"&gt;study of child care centers in Ontario&lt;/a&gt; found workers often recommended that parents visit the doctor for a runny nose or cough; they also said antibiotics would be useful for colds (they are not). More than two-thirds had allowed children to return if they were on antibiotics. Studies in England have also found that about &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198699/" rel="nofollow"&gt;half of policies required antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; for pink eye, and that such policies influence clinicians’ decisions about whether to prescribe them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics, along with some other major health organizations, &lt;a class="external" href="https://nrckids.org/files/CFOC3_updated_final.pdf#page=162" rel="nofollow"&gt;has published recommendations&lt;/a&gt; on when children should be kept from child care centers. Two main criteria should drive considerations, according to the recommendations. If children are so sick that they cannot participate in activities, they should stay home. If they need more attention than the staff can provide, they should stay home, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, it should depend not on whether they are sick, but on how sick. Clearly a very ill child should stay home, but each child experiences illness differently. Fever requires staying away only if it causes changes in activity participation or if it’s accompanied by other symptoms like a sore throat or rash. Vomiting requires staying away if it occurs more than once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1539078/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Multiple studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that the optimal strategy for managing pink eye is to &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776793/" rel="nofollow"&gt;delay antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; — to see if it resolves on its own. There’s certainly no reason to require antibiotics, or to delay a child’s return until they’re on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many schools will probably be too worried about children who spread infections to follow these guidelines. But children are often infectious before they show any symptoms, and we’re never going to be able to prevent all transmission of illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our best bet is still focusing on hygiene, like proper hand washing, covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and not sharing food and drink with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>‘Journalism Thinking’ doesn’t need a business model.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early professional news networks in the 14th and 15th centuries were &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vm7hz" rel="nofollow"&gt;couriers on horseback&lt;/a&gt;, informing warlords and merchants. Even competitors saw the value in shared professional news gathering, when there wasn’t a state-owned alternative. Subscriptions, then, subsidized the first foreign affairs and business reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next 500 years, innovations in distribution and in printing and paper technology shaped professional news-gathering into the 20th century model we most recognize today: advertising revenue subsidized relatively low unit costs to ensure widely available mass media (albeit almost exclusively from &lt;a class="external" href="https://archives.cjr.org/minority_reports/riptide.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;a white male perspective&lt;/a&gt;, but that needs its own post entirely).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we’re well into the first generation of the digital transformation of news-gathering and distribution. Yet we as journalism practitioners are still managing to underestimate how dramatically things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the cofounder and publisher of a small, 20-person media company that produces local community news and is celebrating its 10 anniversary this year, I think this is more urgent and still more alarming than I feel we’re yet collectively addressing. We at &lt;em&gt;Technically Media&lt;/em&gt; fought and limped and carved our way to housing a six-person newsroom, plus additional resources, despite unyielding economic pressure. In that time, I’ve mostly learned that not enough has changed in our expectations for the models to support sustained acts of journalism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we don’t do something about, I think the fall of local journalism will continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat that, I am calling on us all — publishers, journalists, news executives, funders and allies — to consider a greater paradigm shift.  We’ll all need help getting here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;’m not saying we’ve done this flawlessly at Technically Media, quite the opposite; we must do this more aggressively still and more of us need support, guidance and collaborative partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is partly the perspective I’ll be sharing Thursday during &lt;a class="external" href="https://ona19.journalists.org/sessions/23518309/" rel="nofollow"&gt;a session I’m co-hosting at the annual Online News Association&lt;/a&gt; conference in New Orleans. Let me share here the approach I’m taking and offer a call to arms to all of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;##&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it like &lt;a class="external" href="https://hbr.org/2015/09/design-thinking-comes-of-age" rel="nofollow"&gt;the rise of “design thinking.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody has ever said: “but what’s the business model for ‘design thinking?’” That’s because design thinking isn’t bundled with a single revenue model. It is an approach to the world. It is a belief that business and government and society are better served by a methodology that comes with an evolving set of norms and bounds and best practices. We can do the same with the best of newsroom culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than 150 years, the two-income-stream, double-sided marketplace model of advertising and subscriptions was so powerful and effective for so long that we forgot why we would even want to have any other model at all.  We had no resistance, no business model diversity. No leader in our industry is old enough to remember a time when they were in true open-market competition, let alone such seismic industry rediscovery. So mostly our entrepreneurial journalism endeavors of today amount to planting the same crop again — but this time with a newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This is a good time for an important caveat: as part of model diversity, I do think&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2019/a-fresh-look-at-the-rise-of-nonprofit-journalism-and-the-issues-that-remain/" rel="nofollow"&gt; the rise of nonprofit journalism&lt;/a&gt; is important. I think every region will and should have the journalistic equivalent of the regional orchestra: a crucial and influential entity backed by donors and patrons that do the kind of work the market won’t support. This is particularly valuable for smaller geographies. But I think market incentives foster innovation and develop sustainable models like no other. .)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Technology platforms are better suited at having true mass audience: the replacement for a shared identity is already here. Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and their successors will do that work, largely informed by better and smarter approaches to advertising than what journalism practitioners ever did. They’ve made a more efficient model. We lost that war already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a time to give up and say we should all go nonprofit — that’s delaying the reckoning we must confront: the economy is moving ahead briskly with too few true experiments with entrepreneurial journalism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can have a new generation of journalism practitioners, provided we do the critical work of developing those models. To do this, I think it is crucial we understand first that .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that foundation, we can think about the existing markets and industry segments that would benefit from the values of journalism thinking — values like the belief that hard, honest conversations make for better results, that the mirror of storytelling has always shaped humanity’s self-understanding and that third-party referees that are owned by no &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; party, including government, are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This worldview is guiding the work we have done over the last decade at Technically Media, where we have slowly developed two tiny, scrappy niche news sites: one called &lt;a class="external" href="http://Technical.ly" rel="nofollow"&gt;Technical.ly&lt;/a&gt; that tracks how local economies are evolving in a handful of markets and a second called &lt;a class="external" href="http://Generocity.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generocity.org&lt;/a&gt; that reports on the nonprofit and social impact sector of Philadelphia. We have done good, quality, thorough and dependable community reporting for local niches since 2009. I am proud of that journalism, in particular knowing our origins as a bootstrapped Wordpress blog template. We were among the first news organizations to track the rise of civic technology, to pursue unethical startup founders and hollow policy and business imperatives. We’ve developed our own approach to beat reporting that has produced and continues to produce top-flight journalists, no better represented than our current newsroom of &lt;a class="external" href="https://twitter.com/followthelede" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sabrina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="external" href="https://twitter.com/juliezeglen" rel="nofollow"&gt;Julie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="external" href="https://twitter.com/stephenbabcock" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stephen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="external" href="https://twitter.com/OhMichGee" rel="nofollow"&gt;Michelai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="external" href="https://twitter.com/By_paigegross" rel="nofollow"&gt;Paige&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="external" href="https://twitter.com/harlequinn823" rel="nofollow"&gt;Holly&lt;/a&gt;. But I have always believed that in the era we are in, the far, far, far more important, more challenging and more misunderstood work has been on the business modeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spring 2009, we organized an unconference (now called &lt;a class="external" href="http://kleincamp.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Klein News Innovation Camp&lt;/a&gt; and happening for the 11th year Nov. 16) and one of that first day’s themes was that display advertising models could not work for local in a world of web-style scale. We pledged then that we would build a local news organization that would actually approach our sustainability strategy differently. For a few inexperienced, 20-something under-employed reporters that journey took a long, winding and challenging course. We took this path without any allegiance to old models, only to what I now understand to be journalism thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . We had advertising businesses that fit neatly with newsroom values. Journalism is a strategy, not an industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our organization’s evolution is one small example today of what we need lots more of, journalism thinking back in new competitive landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the last decade of our company journey, I changed course for longtime clients, passionate employees and and early fans. In the parlance of today, we were trying to find product-market fit. If we were a software company, this would have likely been too many twists to be worth the trouble. We would have closed, knowing we hadn’t answered a true demand in the market. But our company, and I hope many other journalism practitioners in 2019, are something different. I want us to be part of the first wave that embeds critical journalism thinking into a new generation of commercially viable organizations. Later journalism thinking companies can follow the best practices of a purer approach to fail-fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us at Technically Media, I think we are at another important crossroads that I think is likely representative and telling for other journalism practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have gotten ourselves to the beginning of a far more focused and direct place of business competition. &lt;a class="external" href="http://Technical.ly" rel="nofollow"&gt;Technical.ly&lt;/a&gt; is competing in an open market to support company talent acquisition strategies, in particular employer branding. &lt;a class="external" href="http://generocity.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generocity.org&lt;/a&gt; is developing programming so that large social service providers might rely on us to offer professional development support. . It took us a long time to get here, to both understand this moment and to square off for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to unseat them, and I need help doing it, and I want far more scrappy, news organizations to do the same thing in other market segments. . Let the market determine the best outcomes, but give journalism thinking a chance to be part of the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With new market positions, we can call for new standards and expectations in an era in which c&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/business/business-roundtable-ceos-corporations.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;ompanies owe more to their communities than to shareholders&lt;/a&gt;. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, . I want to challenge all publishers to do similarly: what industry conference could your organization focus on for client development in which your newsroom is a unique differentiator, not an expectation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending more time with clients is crucial, because this is a very new kind of proposition to a client;  This is not unlike the early fights that surely happened between early news orgs and advertisers when entrepreneurial publishers were establishing those early norms. Ad models, remember, were not given to us on a clay tablet from the heavens. They fought for that relationship, and we’re fighting again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When media funders say they want to invest in something that can be sustainable, this is what I think our priority should be. ; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course my point is not that other news organizations should compete in some arcane HR subcategory necessarily. My point is the future of the best of newsroom outcomes is only going to be achieved if we believe journalism thinking must survive, with the aid of market incentives that will ensure they last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;##&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years back, a metro daily newspaper business columnist told me he wouldn’t call us a news organization because our business model was different; I think he used the word “perplexing.” Of course, without realizing it, what he was really telling me was that we weren’t a newspaper, which he was unable to see was not the only way communities could receive free and accessible information. Because that model held firm for centuries, we struggle to wrap our minds around a true change. But we must.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, we all agree in the belief that journalism must be produced for the communities we serve. It must be defended. Of course, there is a healthy jockeying to be better, faster and more informative than someone else on a story of importance. But those are the tactics of professional pride and individual competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to be a community of practitioners who are challenging each other to bring new height of journalism thinking into the world. Call for more examples of that journalism thinking being used in new ways, horseback or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/qTpc0Vj4YoE" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;white typewriter via Unsplash by Bernard Hermant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Here Are Three Questions Still To Be Answered About The Meltdown Of The MIT Media Lab</title><link href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/commentary/2019/09/11/here-are-three-questions-still-to-be-answered-about-the-meltdown-of-the-mit-media-lab" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2019-09-12T00:06:05Z</updated><id>https://www.wgbh.org/news/commentary/2019/09/11/here-are-three-questions-still-to-be-answered-about-the-meltdown-of-the-mit-media-lab</id><summary type="html">&lt;table style="border: 1px solid #E0E0E0; margin: 0; padding: 0; background-color: #F0F0F0" valign="top" align="left" cellpadding="0" width="100%"&gt;

            Here Are Three Questions Still To Be Answered About The Meltdown Of The MIT Media Lab

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;hr style="clear: both; margin: 0 0 24px;"&gt;

&lt;div class="main-content-wrapper"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;a href="http://www.wgbh.org/authenticate/login" rel="nofollow"&amp;gt;http://www.wgbh.org/authenticate/login&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="contentWrapper"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;— Xeni Jardin (@xeni) &lt;a class="external" href="https://twitter.com/xeni/status/1170352857952002048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow"&gt;September 7, 2019&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Was Jardin saying that the Times had the same emails and documents as Farrow but had chosen not to report on them? Not explicitly — but New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen, a prominent media observer, thought that’s what she meant, and he said so on Twitter. It turned out that was not the case, and Rosen responded by issuing a &lt;a class="external" href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1170757175540617221" rel="nofollow"&gt;retraction and correction&lt;/a&gt;. Rosen was then called out by the Times’ Michael Barbaro, host of “The Daily,” &lt;a class="external" href="https://twitter.com/mikiebarb/status/1170913608269795328" rel="nofollow"&gt;who tweeted&lt;/a&gt; at Rosen: “How about doing a lot more reporting and a lot less tweeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There but for the grace of God etc. I was among those who retweeted Jardin’s “THANK GOD FOR @RonanFarrow” tweet, although I refrained from publicly assuming the Times had the documents. Still, that seemed to be a reasonable interpretation of what Jardin was saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what’s next? I think the Times owes us an explanation about what it had and what it didn’t have. I don’t believe the news side would cover for a board member (if anything, the reporters and editors would probably have liked to claim a pelt), but the fact remains that the Times got beaten on an important story with a tie to its own corporate board and that it had devoted considerable resources to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;• Was Ito’s behavior an aberration — or business as usual? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Not to give Ito a pass on dealing with someone as uniquely awful as Epstein. According to all reliable accounts, Epstein destroyed the lives of many girls and young women. Still, Ito is hardly the first person to accept money from dubious sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, MIT (and Harvard) have &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/30/elite-universities-selling-themselves-mit-harvard-saudi-arabia-mohammed-bin-salman" rel="nofollow"&gt;played host&lt;/a&gt; to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, believed by U.S. intelligence to be responsible for the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. (The visit took place before Khashoggi’s death, but bin Sultan was already developing a reputation as a tyrant.) Some of the top cultural and educational institutions in the country have wrestled with what to do about &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/3/26/18282383/sackler-opioids-purdue-museums-donation" rel="nofollow"&gt;donations from the Sackler family&lt;/a&gt;, whose fortune derives from sales of OxyContin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s probably fair to say that within the world of philanthropy, there is an overall sense that one person’s money is as green as another’s, and that there’s no reason not to take it as long as donors understand they are not buying influence. Few hands are clean. For instance, the late David Koch was, for a time, a &lt;a class="external" href="https://current.org/2014/04/activists-turn-up-heat-on-wgbh-over-role-of-david-koch/" rel="nofollow"&gt;member of WGBH’s board&lt;/a&gt;, a matter of some controversy given his and his brother Charles’ &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/kochland-examines-how-the-koch-brothers-made-their-fortune-and-the-influence-it-bought" rel="nofollow"&gt;well-funded campaign&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of climate-change denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend of Ito’s, Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, went so far as to &lt;a class="external" href="https://medium.com/@lessig/on-joi-and-mit-3cb422fe5ae7" rel="nofollow"&gt;write an essay&lt;/a&gt; defending not just Ito’s decision to take Epstein’s money but to maintain Epstein’s anonymity as well. Lessig comes across as genuinely anguished over the events of the past month, so I don’t want to suggest that he made light of the donations. But he does make an interesting argument: that anonymity, rather than being additional evidence of sleaze, was actually appropriate because it prevented Epstein from using his donations to improve his public image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that universities should not be the launderers of reputation,” Lessig wrote. “I think that they should not accept blood money. Or more precisely, I believe that if they are going to accept blood money …, they should only ever accept that money anonymously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a more conventional (and, frankly, more defensible) view was New York Times technology columnist Kara Swisher, who describes herself as a friendly acquaintance of Ito’s. “Mr. Ito’s plummet this weekend was much deserved, certainly swift, and also shocking,” &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/08/opinion/joichi-ito.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;she wrote&lt;/a&gt;, adding: “These corner-cutting ethics have too often become part and parcel to the way business is done in the top echelons of tech, allowing those who violate clear rules and flout decent behavior to thrive and those who object to such behavior to endure exhausting pushback.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seth Mnookin, a science journalist at MIT, said the Ito-Epstein connection should prompt some soul-searching. “Instead of viewing this as an isolated incident,” Mnookin &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/09/09/mit-media-lab-joi-ito-epstein-scandal/" rel="nofollow"&gt;wrote for Stat&lt;/a&gt;, “universities, colleges, and cultural institutions should use it as an impetus to take a difficult look at their own fundraising efforts. Refusing money from a convicted pedophile should be a no-brainer, but it’s time that the larger academic and scientific communities examine our willingness to accept money from donors whose actions directly oppose our values and missions, even if they’re not overtly criminal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some good, tough-minded journalism could help move that process along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;• What are they doing over there?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Since its founding some three decades ago, the Media Lab has been celebrated for its innovative spirit. &lt;a class="external" href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/how-electronic-ink-was-invented/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Electronic ink&lt;/a&gt;, technology used in the original Amazon Kindle, was developed at the lab. Nicholas Negroponte popularized the idea of the &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/13/ebooks-new-reading-bespoke-newspaper-paperli-newspaper-club-paper-later-contributoria" rel="nofollow"&gt;“Daily Me,”&lt;/a&gt; a virtual newspaper tailored the interests of the individual reader. Negroponte was also well-known for his &lt;a class="external" href="http://one.laptop.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;“One Laptop Per Child”&lt;/a&gt; initiative to bring computer access to poor children around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what, exactly has the lab done lately? I’m not sure I know. Several years ago Ethan Zuckerman was the co-author of a &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/2017/03/15/politics-government/major-new-study-shows-political-polarization-mainly-right-wing" rel="nofollow"&gt;much-cited study&lt;/a&gt; showing that media polarization was mainly caused by right-wingers sealing themselves off from mainstream sources of information. It was important work. But, in general, it strikes me that the lab has a lower profile today than it did at one time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that lower profile may be the least of its problems. Several days ago, Business Insider reported that a &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mit-media-lab-personal-food-computers-dont-work-fake-staff-say-2019-9" rel="nofollow"&gt;“personal food computer”&lt;/a&gt; developed at the lab does not actually work, and that “staff were told to place plants grown elsewhere into the devices” before they were shown off to unwitting visitors. Is that an anomaly? Perhaps it's an extreme example. But Justin Peters, a journalist who says that at one time he was smitten with the lab and its ethos, &lt;a class="external" href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/09/mit-media-lab-jeffrey-epstein-joi-ito-moral-rot.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;argued in Slate&lt;/a&gt; that questionable projects carried out on behalf of its corporate sponsors have become a defining characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I realized that the things I had once found so exciting about the Media Lab — the architecturally distinct building, the quirky research teams, the robots and the canisters and the exhibits — amounted to a shrewd act of merchandising intended to lure potential donors into cutting ever-larger checks,” Peters wrote. “The lab’s leaders weren’t&lt;em&gt; averse &lt;/em&gt;to making the world a better place, just as long as the sponsors got what they wanted in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Business Insider report represents a good beginning. But now it’s time for other news organizations to look into what is actually taking place at the lab — and, more broadly, what happens when academic research is bent to serve the agenda of the titans of industry who fund it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WGBH News contributor Dan Kennedy’s blog, Media Nation, is online at &lt;a class="external" href="http://dankennedy.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;dankennedy.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>At Monticello, Mount Vernon and other plantations, talk about slavery is generating backlash</title><link href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/09/08/plantations-are-talking-more-about-slavery-grappling-with-visitors-who-talk-back/?fbclid=IwAR3nbCNJj8Es55Cy3RznWczuxw7yBVUHuasrOJjSuLh3EzyPSxgQeLulAZU" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2019-09-09T16:36:51Z</updated><id>https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/09/08/plantations-are-talking-more-about-slavery-grappling-with-visitors-who-talk-back/?fbclid=IwAR3nbCNJj8Es55Cy3RznWczuxw7yBVUHuasrOJjSuLh3EzyPSxgQeLulAZU</id><summary type="html">&lt;table style="border: 1px solid #E0E0E0; margin: 0; padding: 0; background-color: #F0F0F0" valign="top" align="left" cellpadding="0" width="100%"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A 2011 law undid the core logic of parliamentary government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="OCXTIB"&gt;Fans of parliamentary government have long touted the notion that the British political system could — at least in theory — never get deadlocked in quite the same way as the American system, in which executive and legislative deadlock has become something of a signature feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7pevq"&gt;But this week, the story looks different, as the United Kingdom is currently bogged down in an intractable deadlock between the executive and legislative branches of government over how to approach the looming deadline for Brexit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LL4AbT"&gt;First, Prime Minister Theresa May was unable to secure a parliamentary majority for her preferred approach to Brexit, which led to her resignation and replacement by current Prime Minister Boris Johnson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGmzie"&gt;But Johnson can no more secure a majority for his approach than May could, and his determination to try to push forward anyway has generated a week of political crisis. He decided to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2019/4/11/18300382/brexit-news-glossary-proroguing-no-confidence"&gt;“prorogue”&lt;/a&gt; — that is, temporarily suspend — Parliament for a few weeks in order to shrink the time it had to come up with legislation to thwart his plans. But that prompted a member of his Conservative Party to defect to the centrist Liberal Democrats, costing Johnson his already minuscule parliamentary majority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MQhL5"&gt;Then enough Conservative MPs joined with the opposition parties to take control of the parliamentary agenda from Johnson, setting them up to pass a bill that would explicitly constrain him on Brexit. Johnson, in an effort to get the MPs in line, wants to hold a fresh election that he thinks will give him a majority of like-minded parliamentarians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbyT2r"&gt;But at the moment, it looks like he’s not going to get what he wants and Parliament is going to pass measures over his opposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5dSk0"&gt;It’s something that looks much more like an American-style “separation of powers” system than the traditional British fusion of power. The American system has fewer wild swings in policy trajectory but also makes the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/3/2/8120063/american-democracy-doomed"&gt;total breakdown of the political system&lt;/a&gt; that is possible in the US common. It’s something that is inconceivable in Latin American countries or under a Westminster-style Parliament — at least in theory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgmHsR"&gt;The UK’s problem today is the consequence of a 2011 law that was passed to address a particular set of circumstances but has turned out to have wide-ranging implications for a variety of situations — including introducing the novelty of deadlocks into a system that is not accustomed to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YEMfLz"&gt;Britain’s eight-word constitution and how it constructs its government, explained&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pWQ8NS"&gt;The UK famously lacks a written constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5aEtNJ"&gt;But an old quip has it that you can sum up the whole thing with eight words: “What the Queen-in-Parliament enacts is law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PhCD8"&gt;Initially, Parliament evolved as an institution that existed to check and balance the power of the monarch. And the American political system operates on a kind of analogy to that 18th-century version of British institutions, with the president playing the role of the king (or queen), the Senate the role of the House of Lords, and the House of Representatives the role of the House of Commons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6PKvT"&gt;Over time, however, the Lords were stripped of almost all their real power and a new tradition developed in which the queen would act exclusively on the advice of her prime minister. The prime minister, however, is elected by the House of Commons rather than directly by the voters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="334TV2"&gt;All powers, in other words, are effectively held by the parliamentary majority party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaUPGI"&gt;The queen appoints the leader of the majority party in Parliament as her prime minister; the prime minister decides which bills Parliament votes on; and then those bills are granted the queen’s royal assent on the advice of the prime minister. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgocbk"&gt;Members of the majority party are rarely if ever unanimous in their views, but as party leader, the prime minister can kick them out of the party if they won’t do what he wants. (Johnson says this will happen to the members of his Conservative Party who defied him.) And, more importantly, traditionally the prime minister can dissolve Parliament and call a new election (or, formally speaking, “advise” the queen to do this). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGBWaK"&gt;The prime minister might lose the election, of course, and thus not get what he or she wants. The prime minister also might harbor ambitions that his or her colleagues in Parliament advise are politically untenable — and they may warn the prime minister that they won’t vote for his or her ideas, and thus that insisting on them will trigger an election campaign he or she will lose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YghYzG"&gt;In other words, it’s not a dictatorship where the PM can just do whatever. Mass opinion, the opinion of the members of Parliament, and the interplay between the two play a critical role in shaping outcomes. But you never have a standoff — either the PM gets what they want or there’s a new election, which they either win or lose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GoRkI"&gt;Implicitly underlying this, however, was the presumption that the UK’s election system would deliver something approximating two-party politics with strong majorities. But then everything started to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DxQWFf"&gt;The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act and how the 2010 general election changed things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CoF9XD"&gt;The UK uses a “first past the post” electoral system just like the United States. This means that whichever candidate in a race gets the most votes wins the seat. As a result, third-party votes are mostly “wasted” and for a long time created a strong incentive not to do them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BB3CrK"&gt;But after the 2010 general election, a confluence of global trends and specific circumstances — in particular, the Great Recession of 2008 and Prime Minister Tony Blair’s support for the Iraq War — led to a surge in votes for both the Liberal Democrats (an economically centrist, pro-European party that opposed the war) and a range of small regional parties. No party had a majority in Parliament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbd29K"&gt;Ideologically speaking, the best fit probably would have been a deal between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, but there were two problems here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpfeOy"&gt;First, the Conservatives won a lot more seats than Labour, so there was a strong sense that the former had “won the election” and should get to select the prime minister. Second, even in combination, Labour and the Liberal Democrats were a few seats short of a majority, which meant they would have had to rely on secondary alliances with the regional parties to form a majority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiZzR0"&gt;So instead, the Liberal Democrats opted to work with David Cameron’s Conservative Party and form a coalition cabinet. This is highly unusual in UK politics. But they opted for this course rather than letting Cameron form a minority government, supposedly due to the need for stability in a time of economic crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnnHhV"&gt;To further that goal of stability, the coalition government then passed the &lt;a href="https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06111"&gt;Fixed-Term Parliaments Act of 2011&lt;/a&gt;, which denied the prime minister the authority to unilaterally call a new election. Under the new system, a Parliament would last a full five-year term unless a two-thirds supermajority voted for dissolution and early elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4R2Fc"&gt;This law served its specific purpose and ensured that the coalition lasted its whole five-year term. But it’s now carried forward into a totally different situation and produced an unprecedented ability for the executive and legislative branches to systematically disagree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="q0Afem"&gt;The Brexit gridlock  &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dWGSFz"&gt;The current impasse began with Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May’s efforts to get Parliament to approve the Brexit agreement she’d negotiated with the European Union at the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ORTSt"&gt;Unfortunately, while no one in Parliament could seem to agree on what kind of deal they wanted, they all — including members of her own party — agreed that they didn’t like the deal May had on offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exCIVD"&gt;The Conservative Party contains a large faction that either actively favors a total rupturing of UK-EU ties (“hard Brexit”) or at least believes that a willingness to accept a chaotic “no deal” scenario will improve the UK’s bargaining hand and create a more satisfactory deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BshYn"&gt;That meant that compromise measures designed to guarantee that there wouldn’t need to be a traditional border between Northern Ireland (which as part of the UK would be leaving the EU) and the Republic of Ireland (which is still in the EU) couldn’t pass Parliament with purely Conservative votes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIXWYG"&gt;But rather than prop up May’s compromise efforts, opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn took the position that the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; problem was May and her negotiating position. He wanted a fresh election that he hoped to win, thus enabling him to pursue his own approach to Brexit (what exactly that approach would be &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/27/12040056/brexit-corbyn-labour-coup-benn"&gt;has been a matter of some dispute&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zx8fUs"&gt;Key to this strategy was the belief that Labour was likely to do well in a new election, primarily because of the rise of a new Brexit Party that espoused a harder line than May. Labour believed that vote-splitting between the Conservatives and the Brexit Party could bring them to power, either alone or in partnership with some of the other parties.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuXkTG"&gt;With both Conservatives and members of the opposition blocking her every move, May faced a complete deadlock that eventually led to her resignation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtSuPZ"&gt;Enter Boris Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E13BW8"&gt;Johnson has promised to pull the UK out of the EU by the October 31 deadline, “do or die” — meaning with or without a deal with the EU in place. He also argues that the threat of a disruptive &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/6/18253260/brexit-prepper-stockpiling-goods-eu"&gt;“no deal” Brexit&lt;/a&gt; will intimidate the EU into offering the UK better terms. Johnson is almost certainly wrong about this, and people familiar with Brussels say he’s &lt;a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2019/06/26/did-we-ever-really-understand-how-the-eu-works/"&gt;fundamentally misunderstanding how the European Union works&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aK6eyt"&gt;A critical faction of rebel Conservative MPs disagree with this strategy and sided with the opposition to block his plans. So now Johnson wants new elections — elections that he believes he will win because, having co-opted the hardline position on Brexit, he will secure a unified vote of Brexit supporters, while the skeptics will be divided across several parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbBKRf"&gt;Under the “classic” UK political system, this is exactly what would happen. Johnson would call a new election, and either the rogue Conservative MPs would be replaced by more reliable members, thus enabling Johnson to carry out his agenda unimpeded, or he’d lose big time and someone else would become prime minister and get to try their hand at managing Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOO2Ug"&gt;But under the fixed-term system, this doesn’t work: A new election can be called only if the governing party and the opposition both agree to do one. And for that to happen, basically one party or the other has to miscalculate about who is going to win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vChGL"&gt;Right now, though, Johnson and Corbyn both agree that a fast election would likely help Johnson, so it seems unlikely to happen. The result is a situation that’s become very familiar to Americans: a mix of gridlock and “constitutional hardball” in which party leaders seek to exploit various technicalities or little-used powers to gain advantage and the actual policy outcomes don’t represent any party leader’s stated preference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FKvY1"&gt;Since the main purpose of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act was to secure the stability of one particular coalition government, the law perhaps should have been written to automatically expire after five years. Had that happened, the underlying arguments shaping Brexit would be exactly the same, but the ongoing entrenched political crisis would have been impossible. &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
